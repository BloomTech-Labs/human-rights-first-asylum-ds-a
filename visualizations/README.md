# HRF Asylum DS Notebooks

## Important
The current dynamic judge visualization (side-by-side bar chart) that's being rendered on the frontend of the application was created by Labs 37, and can be found in app/visualizations.py.

## Description
This folder contains experimental `.ipynb` notebooks and `.py` scripts exploring various mock visualizations. All visualizations in this directory aren't in production.
