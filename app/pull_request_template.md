## Description

This is the second version of the judge visualizations, it adds a new function that is able to take in multiple variables instead of just the outcome by protected grounds.
It also adds a new endpoint opposed to refactoring the one that we already have working.
**A new endpoint that includes a drop down menu will be required to be set up by the web team for this to be working.**
