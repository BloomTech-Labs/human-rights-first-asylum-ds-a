    "• This scraper uses the spaCy library in order to gather information about the case. There is no way to ensure it is 100% accurate, except to scrape a document and compare the information gathered directly with the original PDF. \n",
    "\n",
    "• This code currently lives inside a Jupyter Notebook for ease of testing and iteration, but will ultimately need to graduate into a standard .py file. \n",

    "• Scraping is extremely difficult task, as in most cases just searching the document for a keyword isn't enough. It must live in the correct context. No douct the code in this notebook can constantly be improved for a very long time. Before delving into this code, I recommend reading a good chunk of case file PDFs in order to get aquianted with their structre and information."

    "• There are numerous ways text mining can be done. These documents are fairly structured and consistent generally, but there are many 'little things' that need to be accounted for and can only be discovered through the process of getting aquanted with the documents and experimenting with the scraper. Learning the domain is the hardest part, we're not lawyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Something that I avoided doing was relying on newline breaks that typically structure these documents. That's 100% an alternative to explore, and the text that gets converted from PDFs generally preverse these newline separations.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Finally, and good framework to apply when gathering data from these documents is accounting for false negatives and false positives and how you can minimize the two. Again, the only way to validate it to test a batch of documents, see if the data acquired is accurate to what the acutal document says, and go from there.
