They entered the United States at or near Hidalgo, Texas on 2016. Exh. 1.

See id, DHS commenced proceedings by filing the NTAs with the Arlington Immigration Court on May 9, 2016. 1d. During a master calendar hearing on MII 2016, the Respondents, through counsel, admitted the factual allegations contained in their NTs and conceded inadmissibility as charged. Inadmissibility was therefore established by clear and convincing evidence. See 8 CFR. §§ 1240.8, 1240.10(c). Also on July 11, 2016, the Lead Respondent timely filed an Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal (“Form 1-589”), seeking asylum and withholding of removal under the Act and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Exh, 2; see INA § 208(a)(2(B); 8 CFR. § 1208.4(a)(2). MMMM is included in the asylum appl derivative beneficiary. Id. ‘The Lead Respondent testified in support of her applications on I 2017. For the following reasons, her asylum application will be GRANTED. Il, SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE A. Documentary Evidence The Record of Proceedings contains the following documents relevant to the Respondents’ applications: the Lead Respondent’s NTA (Exhibit 1); the Lead Respondent's Form 1-589 (Exhibit 2); Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings, issued July 11, 2016 (Exhibit 3); the Respondents’ witness list and supporting documents, Tabs A-MM (Exhibits 4-6); and the March 8, 2017 Congressional Research Service report on El Salvador (Exhibit 7). All of these documents have been admitted into evidence and considered. B, Testimonial Evidence ‘The Lead Respondent’s testimony and written declaration have been considered in their entirety and are summarized below to the extent relevant to the subsequent analysis. The Lead Respondent was born on]. 1984, in the department of Usulutan, El Salvador. She spent her entire life in the municipality o Her father died when she was six years old, and as a result she was primarily raised by her mother, who instilled in her a belief’ in women’s rights and gender equality. The Lead Respondent strongly believes that women and men should be treated equally and that women deserve respect, which she testified is not a very common belief in El Salvador. Prior to coming to the United States, the Lead Respondent lived in the neighborhood of ees with her partner, [EEE and their three children. She worked as a community promoter/social worker in different communities in Usulutin. In this role, she conducted home visits in various neighborhoods in and around [I She used these visits to speak with her clients about, among other things, gender equality and the importance of healthy eating and hygiene habits. Thus, her work as a community promoter reinforced her belief in ‘women's rights, She ofien had to take long bus rides and/or walk a long way to reach her clients’ | the Matters of| APE. homes. She was required to wear a shirt and vest emblazoned with her organization's logo whenever she was working, including on her commute. One day in early 2015, the Lead Respondent was walking from work to her mother’s house in downtown] To get there, she had to walk along the town’s main street, a dangerous thoroughfare where MS-13 gang members routinely congregated. One of these men, a gang member she knew as — yelled a crude sexual advance at her.' She ignored him and walked away. She was wearing her work shirt and vest at the time. Although the incident upset and offended her, the Lead Respondent believed this was a ‘one-time encounter. However, II continued to harass her every time she walked down the street. She never responded (o him, refusing even to look at him, in the hopes that he would move on. He did not do so. Rather, as she continued to disregard him, his behavior became more aggressive and menacing. He began following her down the street, ofien so closely that she could see him in her peripheral vision. His verbal statements also grow more threatening the longer she denied his advances. He began to tell her that he was going to make her “his woman” by force, whether she liked it or not. The Lead Respondent understood these statements to be implicit threats to rape her and force her to be his “girlfriend.” She knew from stories she had heard in the community that being the “girlfriend” of a gang member meant being obligated to submit sexually not only to that person, but (o other members of his gang as well. HR continued to follow and threaten to rape the Lead Respondent innumerable times over the course of the succeeding year, including when her partner was with her. As his threats continued and increased, she became more and more fearful that her defiance would result in him raping or killing her. Nevertheless, she did not report him to the police, because she knew from news reports that the local police cooperated with the MS-13 gang. She also had heard of people who were killed after reporting gang members. In January 201 moved into an abandoned house three doors away from the Lead Respondent’s home in He walked past her home multiple times per day, and he often made threatening comments to her when he saw her, When this happened, she went inside and prayed he would not try to break into her home. She was under immense stress due to the ongoing threats, and her health began to sufler; she developed recurrent eye infections, neck and back pain, nightmares, and a rash. She was afraid to leave the house. Afier a year of repeated threats, and approximately one month afte, moved into her neighborhood, the Lead Respondent decided that she had nu chvice but to flee. She did not believe that she could have relocated to another part of El Salvador, because she knew that the gang had nationwide contacts, and she was certain that MMI would have been able to find her anywhere in the country. ' The Lead Respondent knew that MEM was an MS-13 member because of the way he dressed, the fact that he spent time with gang members and engaged in gang “lookout” activities, and by his reputation in 3 i Cy ‘The Lead Respondent and her son, IM left El Salvador on February 15, 2016. and their other two children remained in El Salvador. Due to ongoing safety concems in! the children moved to the Lead Respondent's mother’s house. The Lead Respondent believed that if she were to return (o El Salvador, II will rape and Kall her for defying him by escaping to the United States. IIL LAW, ANALYSIS, & FINDINGS A. Credibility and Corroboration The REAL ID Act of 2005 applies to this case because the lead Respondent’s asylum application was filed on or after May 11, 2005. See Matter of $-B-, 24 1&N Dee. 42 (BIA 2006); INA § 240(c4)(A). A credibility determination may be based on the applicant’s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness; the inherent plausibility of her account; the consistency between her written and oral statements; the internal consistency of each such statement; the consistency of each statement with other evidence of record; any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements; or any other factor, without regard {o whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). Considering the totality of the circumstances, I find that the Lead Respondent testified credibly. She provided candid, straightforward, and responsive testimony concerning the events leading to her departure from El Salvador, and her testimony was consistent with her written statement and record evidence. See generally Exhs. 4-7. Moreover, her demeanor was calm and appropriate given the circumstances and did not indicate any attempt to mislead or to embellish her claim, Therefore, I will credit her testimony in its entirety. B. Asylum An asylum applicant has the burden of demonstrating that she is a refugee within the ‘meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987); 8CFLR. § 1208.13(a). A refugee isa person who is unwilling or unable to return to her country of origin, and is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her government, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(a)(42)(A). In addition to establishing cligibility for asylum, the applicant must demonstrate that a grant of asylum is warranted in the exercise of discretion. INA § 208(b)(I)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.14(a). i Past persecution ‘An application claiming past persecution must show that she suffered (1) severe harm amount to persecution, (2) that was inflicted on account of a protected ground, (3) by the government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Hemandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015); Li v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 176-77 (4th Cir. 2005); Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir. 2011); Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). As discussed below, the Lead Respondent has ‘demonstrated past persecution on account of her imputed political opinion. ithe Maes A. i ss 1. Harm rising to the level of persecution “Persecution” entails harm or suffering inflicted upon an individual to punish her for possessing a belief or characteristic the persecutor seeks to overcome. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222-23. Persecution is “an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.” Li, 405 F.3d at 177. Rather, it requires actions above “mere harassment” and includes the “threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom.” Ida; see also Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949. Threats alone may constitute persecution, but only when they are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm, See Matt Z:O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 589 (BIA 2015) (quoting Lim v. INS, 224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir. 2C00)). | find that the lead Respondent experienced severe harm that could amount to past persecution if she could show that the government of El Salvador was not able to protect her at that time. For over a year, the Lead Respondent was stalked and threatened with rape by a man she knew to be a member of one of the world’s most violent criminal organizations. See, e.g., Exh. 4; Exh. 5, Tab T; Exh. 7 at 6. The year-long, continual, escalating threats she experienced went beyond mere harassment. See Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dee. at 58 followed her down the street so closely that she could see his shadow overlapping hers; she was afraid to look directly at him, believing that he would attack her if she did so, He threatened to make her his “girlfriend” by force, which in the context of the society in question was commonly known to be a threat to rape her, force her into conditions tantamount to sexual slavery, and/or murder her. See, ¢.g., Exh. 4, Tab D§ 13 (“[W]hen a gang member demands that a woman become his ‘girlfriend,’ the demand connotes a significant threat to the life of the woman and her family.”), Tab E; Exh. 5, Tabs Q, S at 344 (“Failure to comply [with a demand to become a gang member's sexual partner] is reportedly met with severe reprisals, including homicides . . . or the threat of such violence.”), T-U; Exh. 6, Tabs X, CC, BE, II-JJ, LL. When he eventually moved into her neighborhood, a mere three houses away from her own, his threats took on a more menacing tone and represented a significant risk of imminent danger. She was afraid to leave her house, and she developed numerous health problems due to the overwhelming stress and anxiety she experienced. Although the she was never physically injured, the totality of the harm she suffered due to Il MEE s imminent and menacing threats caused the Lead Respondent to experience significant actual suffering. See Matter of Z-2-O-, 26 I&N Dec. at 589. 2. Source or agent of persecution An applicant for asylum based on past persecution must show she was persecuted by the government or by an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, See Orellana v. Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 151 (4th Cir. 2019); Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950-54; Matter of S-A-, 22 1&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000), “Whether a government is unable or unwilling to control private actors .... isa factual question that must be resolved based on the record in each case.” Hernandez Avalos, 784 F.3d at 951 (internal quotations omitted) (citing Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128). In the present case, the Lead Respondent established that the government of El Salvador was unwilling or unable (o protect her from persecution, Although she never sought protection from police or other authorities in El Salvador, under Fourth Circuit law she was not required to seek government assistance when doing so (1) would have been futile or (2) would have subjected {Inthe Matters i: ee ABB and her to further harm. Orellana, 925 F.3d at 153 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Count conditions in El Salvador in 2016 evidence shows that had the Lead Respondent reported HMM 0 the police, she likely would not have received the protection that she needed and she ikely would have faced an increased risk of harm. First, although there were programs and laws in place that sought to combat gang violence and violence against women, such lawsand programs were ineffectively enforced or poorly implemented. Exh, 4, Tab D 4 21-23 (citing Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador — 2016); Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador ~ 2018 (2018 Human Rights Report) at 1, 10, 16 (noting widespread government corruption and significant violent crime at the hands of organized criminal elements and stating that efforts by authorities to remedy situations where gangs targeted individuals were “generally ineffective”). “[A]ccess to a nominal or ineffectual remedy docs not constitute meaningful recourse, for the foreign government must be both willing and able to offer an applicant protection.” Orellana, 925 F.3d at 152 (internal quotations omitted). Based on the totality of country conditions in El Salvador as of 2016, I find that it would have been futile for the Lead Respondent to seek protection from the government. Second, even had the Lead Respondent reported (EEN t0 the police, the widespread corruption and infiltration of police by the gangs in 2016 might have put her at greater risk of harm. “[A] woman choosing to report sexual advances or violence perpetrated by a gang, ‘member to the police is equivalent to signing her own death warrant, because police communicate with the gangs and the consequence for the woman is typically homicide.” Exh. 4, Tab D 22; sce also Exh. 5, Tab T at 364 (“Those who have refused to help a gang or reported a crime a particularly vulnerable [to murder”). Therefore, the evidence shows that the government of El Salvador was unable to protect the Lead Respondent from the harm that she suffered, fi, Nexus to a protected ground ‘The Lead Respondent asserts that the harm she suffered in El Salvador was on account of her political opinion and/or her membership in a particular social group. For the reasons discussed below, I find that she demonstrated a nexus between the harm she suffered and her actual or imputed political opinion. As such, | need not address the additional protected grounds she raised. To succeed on a claim of persecution on account of political opinion, an applicant must prove that: (1) she actually holds a political opinion or that a political opinion is imputed to her, and (2) she was targeted on account of that opinion. See Abdel-Rahman v, Gonzales, 493 F.3d 444, 450-51 (4th Cir. 2007). When evaluating whether an applicant was persecuted on account of an imputed opinion, “the relevant inquiry is not the political views sincerely held or expressed by the victim, but rather the persecutor's subjective perception of the victim’s views.” Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 254 (4th Cir. 2019). To establish that the harm was committed “on account of” a protected ground, an applicant must demonstrate that a protected ground was “at least one central reason” she was harmed. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159 (4th Cir, 2009). The protected ground need not be the only reason for the persecution; however, it must be more than “incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for the harm,” Quinteros-Mendoza, 556 F.3d at 164 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The persecutor’s motivation is an issue of fact. Matter of S-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 486, 490 (BIA 1996). The i a AMER anc adjudicator must consider not only the “articulated purpose” of a persecutor’s threats, but also the “intertwined reasons” for those threats. Cantillano Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 129 (4th Cir. 2017); Oliva v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 53, 59-60 (4th Cir. 2015). Here, the Lead Respondent's belief in women’s rights and equality constitutes a political opinion. Sec. e.g., Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1242-43 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[W]e have little doubt that feminism qualifies as a political opinion within the meaning of the [Act]”); Respondents’ Pre~ Nearing Brief at 29.178 (cing United States Chizenship and Immigration Services, Asvlum : Female Asylum Applicant jender-Related Claims, 27-28 (Mar. 12, 2008) (“Feminism isa politcal opinion\""); Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed, 2012) (feminist, adj.”: “Of, relating to, or advocating the rights and equality of women”). Although she never explicitly expressed her views to or in the presence of INR it is clear from the record that her actions were interpreted as an expression of a subversive belief regarding the role ‘of women in gang-held territories in El Salvador. See Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 254, Given the totality of the circumstances presented here, I find that these ascribed beliefs constituted a political opinion that imputed to the lead. The record evidence establishes that Salvadoran gang members expect complete submission from women who reside in their territories. At the time the Respondents departed form El Salvador, that country had the highest concentration of gang members per capita in Central America. Exh. 7 at 6. Gangs exercise full territorial control in many neighborhoods throughout the country, including the area where the Lead Respondent lived. See Exh. 4, Tab D 7; Exh. 5, Tab V at 429. Specifically, “[glangs consider women who reside in their sector to be a part of their territory and property, giving the gang the right to sexually exploit these women.” Exh. 4, Tab D. 411. “When a woman refuses to comply with gang demands, the gang member will . . . seek to make clear that his authority and patriarchal power will not be challenged by a woman.” Exh. 4, ‘Tab E 15. “Gangs target such women . .. to make clear that their authority and patriarchal power are not defied by those they perceive to be inferior to them.” Id, 16 (“A woman who refuses (0 comply with gang demands is especially endangered, as gangs have no respect for women and ‘expect complete submission from them.”). ‘These country conditions support the conclusion that when the Lead Respondent refused to submit to NEE s threats, he interpreted this defiance as a challenge to ‘gang’s authority, which in the context of El Salvador constitutes an imputed political opinion. Exh. 5, Tab V at 429-30 (“The ground of political opinion needs to reflect the reality of the specific geographical, historical, political, legal, judicial, and sociocultural context of the country of origin.”); Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 255 (finding that refusal to comply with a gang’s demands might warrant a grant of asylum based on imputed politcal opinion, and remanding for he agency to address this issue). In addition to her actions defying his authority, the Lead Respondent was a community promoter who openly advocated ideas of gender equality among her clients throughout the gang’s territory. [EEN was fully aware of this work, having seen her wearing her uniform around town, and this knowledge likely contributed his imputation of a political opinion. Accordingly, the Lead Respondent demonstrated both that she actually holds a political opinion and that a political opinion was imputed to her by her persecutor. Ith Manes a ABE 2c Moreover, the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the Lead Respondent was persecuted on account of imputed political opinion. | note, first, that there is insufficient evidence that initially targeted her on account of any political opinion. However, while Il HERE s original catcalls merely constituted harassment, his actions toward her became ‘more threatening as she repeatedly ignored his advances, When the Lead Respondent refused 10 succumb to his threats or to even acknowledge his attempts to assert power over her, his behavior became more menacing, and his threats grew increasingly violent, ultimately rising to the level of persecution, as discussed above. Thus, regardless of his motivation for initiating contact with her, the reasons for his persecutory threats and menacing behavior quickly became intertwined with a desire to punish her for the imputed political opinion discussed above. See Cantillano Cruz, 853 F.3d at 129. In other words, the harm amounting to persecution was inflicted not because HEE was interested in pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with the Lead Respondent, but rather to overcome political beliefs regarding women’s rights in the gang's territory that he imputed to her. As such, the persecution the Lead Respondent experienced in El Salvador was carried out in retaliation for her resistance —_—ae and the gang’s authority, and that this persecution was inextricably linked to her imputed political opinion. See Oliva, 807 F.3d at 59-60. Therefore, the Lead Respondent has established past persecution on account of political iii, Well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground DHS can overcome the presumption that the Lead Respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on past harm by showing that: (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that her fear of persecution is no longer well founded; or (2) she could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country, and that it would be reasonable to expect her to do so under all the circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i). DHS did not offer any evidence to rebut the regulatory presumption of future persecution that is triggered by the finding of past persecution. While the government of El Salvador has made substantial strides over the last two years to combat gang violence, the totality of the country conditions evidence shows that there has not been a meaningful change in country conditions, or that the Lead Respondent will be able to relocate to another part of the country to avoid| and his gang’s menacing threats. See Exh. 4, Tab D §¥ 21-22 (noting that government strategies to combat gang and gender-based violence are typically short-lived); Tab E {¥ 28-30; Tabs Y, KK. ‘This conclusion is consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Alvarez-Lagos, which was based on a consideration of both the applicant's political opinion and the fact that she lived in a violent, gang-controlled territory. For the above-stated reasons, the Lead Respondent has demonstrated a presumed well founded fear of future persecution based on imputed political opinion. She is therefore statutorily eligible for asylum. iv. Discretion An applicant must also demonstrate that, in the totality of the circumstances, she merits a favorable exercise of discretion. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. 467, 473 (BIA 1987). A well- founded fear of persecution “should generally outweigh all but the most egregious adverse ‘inthe Matters o AE factors.” Id. at 474; Zuh_v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 504, 507-14 (4th Cir. 2008) (noting that discretionary denials are “exceedingly rare” and require egregious negative activity by the applicant). “The only negative factor in the Lead Respondent's case is the unlawful manner in. which she attempted to come into the United States. However, this negative factor is greatly outweighed by the demonstrated danger of future persecution that she would face if removed to El Salvador. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. at 473. Accordingly, | will grant her asylum application in the exercise of discretion. IV. CONCLUSION ‘The Lead Respondent has demonstrated past persecution and a presumed well-founded fear of future persecution on account of imputed political opinion. Her application for asylum under INA § 208(a) will be granted as a matter of discretion. N's derivative application for asylum is also granted. Because the Respondents’ asylum applications are granted, it is not necesséry to consider their applications for withholding of removal under the Act or for protection under the CAT.

All of these documents have been admitted into evidence and considered.

One of these men, a gang member she knew as — yelled a crude sexual advance at her.' She ignored him and walked away. She was wearing her work shirt and vest at the time. Although the incident upset and offended her, the Lead Respondent believed this was a ‘one-time encounter. However, II continued to harass her every time she walked down the street. She never responded (o him, refusing even to look at him, in the hopes that he would move on. He did not do so. Rather, as she continued to disregard him, his behavior became more aggressive and menacing. He began following her down the street, ofien so closely that she could see him in her peripheral vision. His verbal statements also grow more threatening the longer she denied his advances. He began to tell her that he was going to make her “his woman” by force, whether she liked it or not. The Lead Respondent understood these statements to be implicit threats to rape her and force her to be his “girlfriend.” She knew from stories she had heard in the community that being the “girlfriend” of a gang member meant being obligated to submit sexually not only to that person, but (o other members of his gang as well. HR continued to follow and threaten to rape the Lead Respondent innumerable times over the course of the succeeding year, including when her partner was with her. As his threats continued and increased, she became more and more fearful that her defiance would result in him raping or killing her. Nevertheless, she did not report him to the police, because she knew from news reports that the local police cooperated with the MS-13 gang. She also had heard of people who were killed after reporting gang members. In January 201 moved into an abandoned house three doors away from the Lead Respondent’s home in He walked past her home multiple times per day, and he often made threatening comments to her when he saw her, When this happened, she went inside and prayed he would not try to break into her home. She was under immense stress due to the ongoing threats, and her health began to sufler; she developed recurrent eye infections, neck and back pain, nightmares, and a rash. She was afraid to leave the house. Afier a year of repeated threats, and approximately one month afte, moved into her neighborhood, the Lead Respondent decided that she had nu chvice but to flee. She did not believe that she could have relocated to another part of El Salvador, because she knew that the gang had nationwide contacts, and she was certain that MMI would have been able to find her anywhere in the country. ' The Lead Respondent knew that MEM was an MS-13 member because of the way he dressed, the fact that he spent time with gang members and engaged in gang “lookout” activities, and by his reputation in 3 i Cy ‘The Lead Respondent and her son, IM left El Salvador on February 15, 2016. and their other two children remained in El Salvador. Due to ongoing safety concems in! the children moved to the Lead Respondent's mother’s house. The Lead Respondent believed that if she were to return (o El Salvador, II will rape and Kall her for defying him by escaping to the United States. IIL LAW, ANALYSIS, & FINDINGS A. Credibility and Corroboration The REAL ID Act of 2005 applies to this case because the lead Respondent’s asylum application was filed on or after May 11, 2005. See Matter of $-B-, 24 1&N Dee. 42 (BIA 2006); INA § 240(c4)(A). A credibility determination may be based on the applicant’s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness; the inherent plausibility of her account; the consistency between her written and oral statements; the internal consistency of each such statement; the consistency of each statement with other evidence of record; any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements; or any other factor, without regard {o whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). Considering the totality of the circumstances, I find that the Lead Respondent testified credibly. She provided candid, straightforward, and responsive testimony concerning the events leading to her departure from El Salvador, and her testimony was consistent with her written statement and record evidence. See generally Exhs. 4-7. Moreover, her demeanor was calm and appropriate given the circumstances and did not indicate any attempt to mislead or to embellish her claim, Therefore, I will credit her testimony in its entirety. B. Asylum An asylum applicant has the burden of demonstrating that she is a refugee within the ‘meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987); 8CFLR. § 1208.13(a). A refugee isa person who is unwilling or unable to return to her country of origin, and is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her government, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(a)(42)(A). In addition to establishing cligibility for asylum, the applicant must demonstrate that a grant of asylum is warranted in the exercise of discretion. INA § 208(b)(I)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.14(a). i Past persecution ‘An application claiming past persecution must show that she suffered (1) severe harm amount to persecution, (2) that was inflicted on account of a protected ground, (3) by the government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Hemandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015); Li v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 176-77 (4th Cir. 2005); Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir. 2011); Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). As discussed below, the Lead Respondent has ‘demonstrated past persecution on account of her imputed political opinion. ithe Maes A. i ss 1. Harm rising to the level of persecution “Persecution” entails harm or suffering inflicted upon an individual to punish her for possessing a belief or characteristic the persecutor seeks to overcome. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222-23. Persecution is “an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.” Li, 405 F.3d at 177. Rather, it requires actions above “mere harassment” and includes the “threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom.” Ida; see also Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949. Threats alone may constitute persecution, but only when they are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm, See Matt Z:O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 589 (BIA 2015) (quoting Lim v. INS, 224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir. 2C00)). | find that the lead Respondent experienced severe harm that could amount to past persecution if she could show that the government of El Salvador was not able to protect her at that time. For over a year, the Lead Respondent was stalked and threatened with rape by a man she knew to be a member of one of the world’s most violent criminal organizations. See, e.g., Exh. 4; Exh. 5, Tab T; Exh. 7 at 6. The year-long, continual, escalating threats she experienced went beyond mere harassment. See Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dee. at 58 followed her down the street so closely that she could see his shadow overlapping hers; she was afraid to look directly at him, believing that he would attack her if she did so, He threatened to make her his “girlfriend” by force, which in the context of the society in question was commonly known to be a threat to rape her, force her into conditions tantamount to sexual slavery, and/or murder her. See, ¢.g., Exh. 4, Tab D§ 13 (“[W]hen a gang member demands that a woman become his ‘girlfriend,’ the demand connotes a significant threat to the life of the woman and her family.”), Tab E; Exh. 5, Tabs Q, S at 344 (“Failure to comply [with a demand to become a gang member's sexual partner] is reportedly met with severe reprisals, including homicides . . . or the threat of such violence.”), T-U; Exh. 6, Tabs X, CC, BE, II-JJ, LL. When he eventually moved into her neighborhood, a mere three houses away from her own, his threats took on a more menacing tone and represented a significant risk of imminent danger. She was afraid to leave her house, and she developed numerous health problems due to the overwhelming stress and anxiety she experienced. Although the she was never physically injured, the totality of the harm she suffered due to Il MEE s imminent and menacing threats caused the Lead Respondent to experience significant actual suffering. See Matter of Z-2-O-, 26 I&N Dec. at 589. 2. Source or agent of persecution An applicant for asylum based on past persecution must show she was persecuted by the government or by an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, See Orellana v. Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 151 (4th Cir. 2019); Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950-54; Matter of S-A-, 22 1&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000), “Whether a government is unable or unwilling to control private actors .... isa factual question that must be resolved based on the record in each case.” Hernandez Avalos, 784 F.3d at 951 (internal quotations omitted) (citing Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128). In the present case, the Lead Respondent established that the government of El Salvador was unwilling or unable (o protect her from persecution, Although she never sought protection from police or other authorities in El Salvador, under Fourth Circuit law she was not required to seek government assistance when doing so (1) would have been futile or (2) would have subjected {Inthe Matters i: ee ABB and her to further harm. Orellana, 925 F.3d at 153 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Count conditions in El Salvador in 2016 evidence shows that had the Lead Respondent reported HMM 0 the police, she likely would not have received the protection that she needed and she ikely would have faced an increased risk of harm. First, although there were programs and laws in place that sought to combat gang violence and violence against women, such lawsand programs were ineffectively enforced or poorly implemented. Exh, 4, Tab D 4 21-23 (citing Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador — 2016); Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador ~ 2018 (2018 Human Rights Report) at 1, 10, 16 (noting widespread government corruption and significant violent crime at the hands of organized criminal elements and stating that efforts by authorities to remedy situations where gangs targeted individuals were “generally ineffective”). “[A]ccess to a nominal or ineffectual remedy docs not constitute meaningful recourse, for the foreign government must be both willing and able to offer an applicant protection.” Orellana, 925 F.3d at 152 (internal quotations omitted). Based on the totality of country conditions in El Salvador as of 2016, I find that it would have been futile for the Lead Respondent to seek protection from the government. Second, even had the Lead Respondent reported (EEN t0 the police, the widespread corruption and infiltration of police by the gangs in 2016 might have put her at greater risk of harm. “[A] woman choosing to report sexual advances or violence perpetrated by a gang, ‘member to the police is equivalent to signing her own death warrant, because police communicate with the gangs and the consequence for the woman is typically homicide.” Exh. 4, Tab D 22; sce also Exh. 5, Tab T at 364 (“Those who have refused to help a gang or reported a crime a particularly vulnerable [to murder”). Therefore, the evidence shows that the government of El Salvador was unable to protect the Lead Respondent from the harm that she suffered, fi, Nexus to a protected ground ‘The Lead Respondent asserts that the harm she suffered in El Salvador was on account of her political opinion and/or her membership in a particular social group. For the reasons discussed below, I find that she demonstrated a nexus between the harm she suffered and her actual or imputed political opinion. As such, | need not address the additional protected grounds she raised. To succeed on a claim of persecution on account of political opinion, an applicant must prove that: (1) she actually holds a political opinion or that a political opinion is imputed to her, and (2) she was targeted on account of that opinion. See Abdel-Rahman v, Gonzales, 493 F.3d 444, 450-51 (4th Cir. 2007). When evaluating whether an applicant was persecuted on account of an imputed opinion, “the relevant inquiry is not the political views sincerely held or expressed by the victim, but rather the persecutor's subjective perception of the victim’s views.” Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 254 (4th Cir. 2019). To establish that the harm was committed “on account of” a protected ground, an applicant must demonstrate that a protected ground was “at least one central reason” she was harmed. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159 (4th Cir, 2009). The protected ground need not be the only reason for the persecution; however, it must be more than “incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for the harm,” Quinteros-Mendoza, 556 F.3d at 164 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The persecutor’s motivation is an issue of fact. Matter of S-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 486, 490 (BIA 1996). The i a AMER anc adjudicator must consider not only the “articulated purpose” of a persecutor’s threats, but also the “intertwined reasons” for those threats. Cantillano Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 129 (4th Cir. 2017); Oliva v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 53, 59-60 (4th Cir. 2015). Here, the Lead Respondent's belief in women’s rights and equality constitutes a political opinion. Sec. e.g., Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1242-43 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[W]e have little doubt that feminism qualifies as a political opinion within the meaning of the [Act]”); Respondents’ Pre~ Nearing Brief at 29.178 (cing United States Chizenship and Immigration Services, Asvlum : Female Asylum Applicant jender-Related Claims, 27-28 (Mar. 12, 2008) (“Feminism isa politcal opinion\""); Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed, 2012) (feminist, adj.”: “Of, relating to, or advocating the rights and equality of women”). Although she never explicitly expressed her views to or in the presence of INR it is clear from the record that her actions were interpreted as an expression of a subversive belief regarding the role ‘of women in gang-held territories in El Salvador. See Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 254, Given the totality of the circumstances presented here, I find that these ascribed beliefs constituted a political opinion that imputed to the lead. The record evidence establishes that Salvadoran gang members expect complete submission from women who reside in their territories. At the time the Respondents departed form El Salvador, that country had the highest concentration of gang members per capita in Central America. Exh. 7 at 6. Gangs exercise full territorial control in many neighborhoods throughout the country, including the area where the Lead Respondent lived. See Exh. 4, Tab D 7; Exh. 5, Tab V at 429. Specifically, “[glangs consider women who reside in their sector to be a part of their territory and property, giving the gang the right to sexually exploit these women.” Exh. 4, Tab D. 411. “When a woman refuses to comply with gang demands, the gang member will . . . seek to make clear that his authority and patriarchal power will not be challenged by a woman.” Exh. 4, ‘Tab E 15. “Gangs target such women . .. to make clear that their authority and patriarchal power are not defied by those they perceive to be inferior to them.” Id, 16 (“A woman who refuses (0 comply with gang demands is especially endangered, as gangs have no respect for women and ‘expect complete submission from them.”). ‘These country conditions support the conclusion that when the Lead Respondent refused to submit to NEE s threats, he interpreted this defiance as a challenge to ‘gang’s authority, which in the context of El Salvador constitutes an imputed political opinion. Exh. 5, Tab V at 429-30 (“The ground of political opinion needs to reflect the reality of the specific geographical, historical, political, legal, judicial, and sociocultural context of the country of origin.”); Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 255 (finding that refusal to comply with a gang’s demands might warrant a grant of asylum based on imputed politcal opinion, and remanding for he agency to address this issue). In addition to her actions defying his authority, the Lead Respondent was a community promoter who openly advocated ideas of gender equality among her clients throughout the gang’s territory. [EEN was fully aware of this work, having seen her wearing her uniform around town, and this knowledge likely contributed his imputation of a political opinion. Accordingly, the Lead Respondent demonstrated both that she actually holds a political opinion and that a political opinion was imputed to her by her persecutor. Ith Manes a ABE 2c Moreover, the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the Lead Respondent was persecuted on account of imputed political opinion. | note, first, that there is insufficient evidence that initially targeted her on account of any political opinion. However, while Il HERE s original catcalls merely constituted harassment, his actions toward her became ‘more threatening as she repeatedly ignored his advances, When the Lead Respondent refused 10 succumb to his threats or to even acknowledge his attempts to assert power over her, his behavior became more menacing, and his threats grew increasingly violent, ultimately rising to the level of persecution, as discussed above. Thus, regardless of his motivation for initiating contact with her, the reasons for his persecutory threats and menacing behavior quickly became intertwined with a desire to punish her for the imputed political opinion discussed above. See Cantillano Cruz, 853 F.3d at 129. In other words, the harm amounting to persecution was inflicted not because HEE was interested in pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with the Lead Respondent, but rather to overcome political beliefs regarding women’s rights in the gang's territory that he imputed to her. As such, the persecution the Lead Respondent experienced in El Salvador was carried out in retaliation for her resistance —_—ae and the gang’s authority, and that this persecution was inextricably linked to her imputed political opinion. See Oliva, 807 F.3d at 59-60. Therefore, the Lead Respondent has established past persecution on account of political iii, Well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground DHS can overcome the presumption that the Lead Respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on past harm by showing that: (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that her fear of persecution is no longer well founded; or (2) she could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country, and that it would be reasonable to expect her to do so under all the circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i). DHS did not offer any evidence to rebut the regulatory presumption of future persecution that is triggered by the finding of past persecution. While the government of El Salvador has made substantial strides over the last two years to combat gang violence, the totality of the country conditions evidence shows that there has not been a meaningful change in country conditions, or that the Lead Respondent will be able to relocate to another part of the country to avoid| and his gang’s menacing threats. See Exh. 4, Tab D §¥ 21-22 (noting that government strategies to combat gang and gender-based violence are typically short-lived); Tab E {¥ 28-30; Tabs Y, KK. ‘This conclusion is consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Alvarez-Lagos, which was based on a consideration of both the applicant's political opinion and the fact that she lived in a violent, gang-controlled territory. For the above-stated reasons, the Lead Respondent has demonstrated a presumed well founded fear of future persecution based on imputed political opinion. She is therefore statutorily eligible for asylum. iv. Discretion An applicant must also demonstrate that, in the totality of the circumstances, she merits a favorable exercise of discretion. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. 467, 473 (BIA 1987). A well- founded fear of persecution “should generally outweigh all but the most egregious adverse ‘inthe Matters o AE factors.” Id. at 474; Zuh_v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 504, 507-14 (4th Cir. 2008) (noting that discretionary denials are “exceedingly rare” and require egregious negative activity by the applicant). “The only negative factor in the Lead Respondent's case is the unlawful manner in. which she attempted to come into the United States. However, this negative factor is greatly outweighed by the demonstrated danger of future persecution that she would face if removed to El Salvador. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. at 473. Accordingly, | will grant her asylum application in the exercise of discretion. IV. CONCLUSION ‘The Lead Respondent has demonstrated past persecution and a presumed well-founded fear of future persecution on account of imputed political opinion. Her application for asylum under INA § 208(a) will be granted as a matter of discretion. N's derivative application for asylum is also granted. Because the Respondents’ asylum applications are granted, it is not necesséry to consider their applications for withholding of removal under the Act or for protection under the CAT.

Documentary Evidence The Record of Proceedings contains the following documents relevant to the Respondents’ applications: the Lead Respondent’s NTA (Exhibit 1); the Lead Respondent's Form 1-589 (Exhibit 2); Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings, issued July 11, 2016 (Exhibit 3); the Respondents’ witness list and supporting documents, Tabs A-MM (Exhibits 4-6); and the March 8, 2017 Congressional Research Service report on El Salvador (Exhibit 7). All of these documents have been admitted into evidence and considered. B, Testimonial Evidence ‘The Lead Respondent’s testimony and written declaration have been considered in their entirety and are summarized below to the extent relevant to the subsequent analysis. The Lead Respondent was born on]. 1984, in the department of Usulutan, El Salvador. She spent her entire life in the municipality o Her father died when she was six years old, and as a result she was primarily raised by her mother, who instilled in her a belief’ in women’s rights and gender equality. The Lead Respondent strongly believes that women and men should be treated equally and that women deserve respect, which she testified is not a very common belief in El Salvador. Prior to coming to the United States, the Lead Respondent lived in the neighborhood of ees with her partner, [EEE and their three children. She worked as a community promoter/social worker in different communities in Usulutin. In this role, she conducted home visits in various neighborhoods in and around [I She used these visits to speak with her clients about, among other things, gender equality and the importance of healthy eating and hygiene habits. Thus, her work as a community promoter reinforced her belief in ‘women's rights, She ofien had to take long bus rides and/or walk a long way to reach her clients’ | the Matters of| APE. homes. She was required to wear a shirt and vest emblazoned with her organization's logo whenever she was working, including on her commute. One day in early 2015, the Lead Respondent was walking from work to her mother’s house in downtown] To get there, she had to walk along the town’s main street, a dangerous thoroughfare where MS-13 gang members routinely congregated. One of these men, a gang member she knew as — yelled a crude sexual advance at her.' She ignored him and walked away. She was wearing her work shirt and vest at the time. Although the incident upset and offended her, the Lead Respondent believed this was a ‘one-time encounter. However, II continued to harass her every time she walked down the street. She never responded (o him, refusing even to look at him, in the hopes that he would move on. He did not do so. Rather, as she continued to disregard him, his behavior became more aggressive and menacing. He began following her down the street, ofien so closely that she could see him in her peripheral vision. His verbal statements also grow more threatening the longer she denied his advances. He began to tell her that he was going to make her “his woman” by force, whether she liked it or not. The Lead Respondent understood these statements to be implicit threats to rape her and force her to be his “girlfriend.” She knew from stories she had heard in the community that being the “girlfriend” of a gang member meant being obligated to submit sexually not only to that person, but (o other members of his gang as well. HR continued to follow and threaten to rape the Lead Respondent innumerable times over the course of the succeeding year, including when her partner was with her. As his threats continued and increased, she became more and more fearful that her defiance would result in him raping or killing her. Nevertheless, she did not report him to the police, because she knew from news reports that the local police cooperated with the MS-13 gang. She also had heard of people who were killed after reporting gang members. In January 201 moved into an abandoned house three doors away from the Lead Respondent’s home in He walked past her home multiple times per day, and he often made threatening comments to her when he saw her, When this happened, she went inside and prayed he would not try to break into her home. She was under immense stress due to the ongoing threats, and her health began to sufler; she developed recurrent eye infections, neck and back pain, nightmares, and a rash. She was afraid to leave the house. Afier a year of repeated threats, and approximately one month afte, moved into her neighborhood, the Lead Respondent decided that she had nu chvice but to flee. She did not believe that she could have relocated to another part of El Salvador, because she knew that the gang had nationwide contacts, and she was certain that MMI would have been able to find her anywhere in the country. ' The Lead Respondent knew that MEM was an MS-13 member because of the way he dressed, the fact that he spent time with gang members and engaged in gang “lookout” activities, and by his reputation in 3 i Cy ‘The Lead Respondent and her son, IM left El Salvador on February 15, 2016. and their other two children remained in El Salvador. Due to ongoing safety concems in! the children moved to the Lead Respondent's mother’s house. The Lead Respondent believed that if she were to return (o El Salvador, II will rape and Kall her for defying him by escaping to the United States. IIL LAW, ANALYSIS, & FINDINGS A. Credibility and Corroboration The REAL ID Act of 2005 applies to this case because the lead Respondent’s asylum application was filed on or after May 11, 2005. See Matter of $-B-, 24 1&N Dee. 42 (BIA 2006); INA § 240(c4)(A). A credibility determination may be based on the applicant’s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness; the inherent plausibility of her account; the consistency between her written and oral statements; the internal consistency of each such statement; the consistency of each statement with other evidence of record; any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements; or any other factor, without regard {o whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). Considering the totality of the circumstances, I find that the Lead Respondent testified credibly. She provided candid, straightforward, and responsive testimony concerning the events leading to her departure from El Salvador, and her testimony was consistent with her written statement and record evidence. See generally Exhs. 4-7. Moreover, her demeanor was calm and appropriate given the circumstances and did not indicate any attempt to mislead or to embellish her claim, Therefore, I will credit her testimony in its entirety. B. Asylum An asylum applicant has the burden of demonstrating that she is a refugee within the ‘meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987); 8CFLR. § 1208.13(a). A refugee isa person who is unwilling or unable to return to her country of origin, and is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her government, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(a)(42)(A). In addition to establishing cligibility for asylum, the applicant must demonstrate that a grant of asylum is warranted in the exercise of discretion. INA § 208(b)(I)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.14(a). i Past persecution ‘An application claiming past persecution must show that she suffered (1) severe harm amount to persecution, (2) that was inflicted on account of a protected ground, (3) by the government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Hemandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015); Li v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 176-77 (4th Cir. 2005); Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir. 2011); Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). As discussed below, the Lead Respondent has ‘demonstrated past persecution on account of her imputed political opinion. ithe Maes A. i ss 1. Harm rising to the level of persecution “Persecution” entails harm or suffering inflicted upon an individual to punish her for possessing a belief or characteristic the persecutor seeks to overcome. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222-23. Persecution is “an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.” Li, 405 F.3d at 177. Rather, it requires actions above “mere harassment” and includes the “threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom.” Ida; see also Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949. Threats alone may constitute persecution, but only when they are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm, See Matt Z:O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 589 (BIA 2015) (quoting Lim v. INS, 224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir. 2C00)). | find that the lead Respondent experienced severe harm that could amount to past persecution if she could show that the government of El Salvador was not able to protect her at that time. For over a year, the Lead Respondent was stalked and threatened with rape by a man she knew to be a member of one of the world’s most violent criminal organizations. See, e.g., Exh. 4; Exh. 5, Tab T; Exh. 7 at 6. The year-long, continual, escalating threats she experienced went beyond mere harassment. See Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dee. at 58 followed her down the street so closely that she could see his shadow overlapping hers; she was afraid to look directly at him, believing that he would attack her if she did so, He threatened to make her his “girlfriend” by force, which in the context of the society in question was commonly known to be a threat to rape her, force her into conditions tantamount to sexual slavery, and/or murder her. See, ¢.g., Exh. 4, Tab D§ 13 (“[W]hen a gang member demands that a woman become his ‘girlfriend,’ the demand connotes a significant threat to the life of the woman and her family.”), Tab E; Exh. 5, Tabs Q, S at 344 (“Failure to comply [with a demand to become a gang member's sexual partner] is reportedly met with severe reprisals, including homicides . . . or the threat of such violence.”), T-U; Exh. 6, Tabs X, CC, BE, II-JJ, LL. When he eventually moved into her neighborhood, a mere three houses away from her own, his threats took on a more menacing tone and represented a significant risk of imminent danger. She was afraid to leave her house, and she developed numerous health problems due to the overwhelming stress and anxiety she experienced. Although the she was never physically injured, the totality of the harm she suffered due to Il MEE s imminent and menacing threats caused the Lead Respondent to experience significant actual suffering. See Matter of Z-2-O-, 26 I&N Dec. at 589. 2. Source or agent of persecution An applicant for asylum based on past persecution must show she was persecuted by the government or by an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, See Orellana v. Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 151 (4th Cir. 2019); Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950-54; Matter of S-A-, 22 1&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000), “Whether a government is unable or unwilling to control private actors .... isa factual question that must be resolved based on the record in each case.” Hernandez Avalos, 784 F.3d at 951 (internal quotations omitted) (citing Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128). In the present case, the Lead Respondent established that the government of El Salvador was unwilling or unable (o protect her from persecution, Although she never sought protection from police or other authorities in El Salvador, under Fourth Circuit law she was not required to seek government assistance when doing so (1) would have been futile or (2) would have subjected {Inthe Matters i: ee ABB and her to further harm. Orellana, 925 F.3d at 153 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Count conditions in El Salvador in 2016 evidence shows that had the Lead Respondent reported HMM 0 the police, she likely would not have received the protection that she needed and she ikely would have faced an increased risk of harm. First, although there were programs and laws in place that sought to combat gang violence and violence against women, such lawsand programs were ineffectively enforced or poorly implemented. Exh, 4, Tab D 4 21-23 (citing Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador — 2016); Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador ~ 2018 (2018 Human Rights Report) at 1, 10, 16 (noting widespread government corruption and significant violent crime at the hands of organized criminal elements and stating that efforts by authorities to remedy situations where gangs targeted individuals were “generally ineffective”). “[A]ccess to a nominal or ineffectual remedy docs not constitute meaningful recourse, for the foreign government must be both willing and able to offer an applicant protection.” Orellana, 925 F.3d at 152 (internal quotations omitted). Based on the totality of country conditions in El Salvador as of 2016, I find that it would have been futile for the Lead Respondent to seek protection from the government. Second, even had the Lead Respondent reported (EEN t0 the police, the widespread corruption and infiltration of police by the gangs in 2016 might have put her at greater risk of harm. “[A] woman choosing to report sexual advances or violence perpetrated by a gang, ‘member to the police is equivalent to signing her own death warrant, because police communicate with the gangs and the consequence for the woman is typically homicide.” Exh. 4, Tab D 22; sce also Exh. 5, Tab T at 364 (“Those who have refused to help a gang or reported a crime a particularly vulnerable [to murder”). Therefore, the evidence shows that the government of El Salvador was unable to protect the Lead Respondent from the harm that she suffered, fi, Nexus to a protected ground ‘The Lead Respondent asserts that the harm she suffered in El Salvador was on account of her political opinion and/or her membership in a particular social group. For the reasons discussed below, I find that she demonstrated a nexus between the harm she suffered and her actual or imputed political opinion. As such, | need not address the additional protected grounds she raised. To succeed on a claim of persecution on account of political opinion, an applicant must prove that: (1) she actually holds a political opinion or that a political opinion is imputed to her, and (2) she was targeted on account of that opinion. See Abdel-Rahman v, Gonzales, 493 F.3d 444, 450-51 (4th Cir. 2007). When evaluating whether an applicant was persecuted on account of an imputed opinion, “the relevant inquiry is not the political views sincerely held or expressed by the victim, but rather the persecutor's subjective perception of the victim’s views.” Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 254 (4th Cir. 2019). To establish that the harm was committed “on account of” a protected ground, an applicant must demonstrate that a protected ground was “at least one central reason” she was harmed. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159 (4th Cir, 2009). The protected ground need not be the only reason for the persecution; however, it must be more than “incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for the harm,” Quinteros-Mendoza, 556 F.3d at 164 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The persecutor’s motivation is an issue of fact. Matter of S-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 486, 490 (BIA 1996). The i a AMER anc adjudicator must consider not only the “articulated purpose” of a persecutor’s threats, but also the “intertwined reasons” for those threats. Cantillano Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 129 (4th Cir. 2017); Oliva v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 53, 59-60 (4th Cir. 2015). Here, the Lead Respondent's belief in women’s rights and equality constitutes a political opinion. Sec. e.g., Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1242-43 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[W]e have little doubt that feminism qualifies as a political opinion within the meaning of the [Act]”); Respondents’ Pre~ Nearing Brief at 29.178 (cing United States Chizenship and Immigration Services, Asvlum : Female Asylum Applicant jender-Related Claims, 27-28 (Mar. 12, 2008) (“Feminism isa politcal opinion\""); Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed, 2012) (feminist, adj.”: “Of, relating to, or advocating the rights and equality of women”). Although she never explicitly expressed her views to or in the presence of INR it is clear from the record that her actions were interpreted as an expression of a subversive belief regarding the role ‘of women in gang-held territories in El Salvador. See Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 254, Given the totality of the circumstances presented here, I find that these ascribed beliefs constituted a political opinion that imputed to the lead. The record evidence establishes that Salvadoran gang members expect complete submission from women who reside in their territories. At the time the Respondents departed form El Salvador, that country had the highest concentration of gang members per capita in Central America. Exh. 7 at 6. Gangs exercise full territorial control in many neighborhoods throughout the country, including the area where the Lead Respondent lived. See Exh. 4, Tab D 7; Exh. 5, Tab V at 429. Specifically, “[glangs consider women who reside in their sector to be a part of their territory and property, giving the gang the right to sexually exploit these women.” Exh. 4, Tab D. 411. “When a woman refuses to comply with gang demands, the gang member will . . . seek to make clear that his authority and patriarchal power will not be challenged by a woman.” Exh. 4, ‘Tab E 15. “Gangs target such women . .. to make clear that their authority and patriarchal power are not defied by those they perceive to be inferior to them.” Id, 16 (“A woman who refuses (0 comply with gang demands is especially endangered, as gangs have no respect for women and ‘expect complete submission from them.”). ‘These country conditions support the conclusion that when the Lead Respondent refused to submit to NEE s threats, he interpreted this defiance as a challenge to ‘gang’s authority, which in the context of El Salvador constitutes an imputed political opinion. Exh. 5, Tab V at 429-30 (“The ground of political opinion needs to reflect the reality of the specific geographical, historical, political, legal, judicial, and sociocultural context of the country of origin.”); Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 255 (finding that refusal to comply with a gang’s demands might warrant a grant of asylum based on imputed politcal opinion, and remanding for he agency to address this issue). In addition to her actions defying his authority, the Lead Respondent was a community promoter who openly advocated ideas of gender equality among her clients throughout the gang’s territory. [EEN was fully aware of this work, having seen her wearing her uniform around town, and this knowledge likely contributed his imputation of a political opinion. Accordingly, the Lead Respondent demonstrated both that she actually holds a political opinion and that a political opinion was imputed to her by her persecutor. Ith Manes a ABE 2c Moreover, the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the Lead Respondent was persecuted on account of imputed political opinion. | note, first, that there is insufficient evidence that initially targeted her on account of any political opinion. However, while Il HERE s original catcalls merely constituted harassment, his actions toward her became ‘more threatening as she repeatedly ignored his advances, When the Lead Respondent refused 10 succumb to his threats or to even acknowledge his attempts to assert power over her, his behavior became more menacing, and his threats grew increasingly violent, ultimately rising to the level of persecution, as discussed above. Thus, regardless of his motivation for initiating contact with her, the reasons for his persecutory threats and menacing behavior quickly became intertwined with a desire to punish her for the imputed political opinion discussed above. See Cantillano Cruz, 853 F.3d at 129. In other words, the harm amounting to persecution was inflicted not because HEE was interested in pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with the Lead Respondent, but rather to overcome political beliefs regarding women’s rights in the gang's territory that he imputed to her. As such, the persecution the Lead Respondent experienced in El Salvador was carried out in retaliation for her resistance —_—ae and the gang’s authority, and that this persecution was inextricably linked to her imputed political opinion. See Oliva, 807 F.3d at 59-60. Therefore, the Lead Respondent has established past persecution on account of political iii, Well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground DHS can overcome the presumption that the Lead Respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on past harm by showing that: (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that her fear of persecution is no longer well founded; or (2) she could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country, and that it would be reasonable to expect her to do so under all the circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i). DHS did not offer any evidence to rebut the regulatory presumption of future persecution that is triggered by the finding of past persecution. While the government of El Salvador has made substantial strides over the last two years to combat gang violence, the totality of the country conditions evidence shows that there has not been a meaningful change in country conditions, or that the Lead Respondent will be able to relocate to another part of the country to avoid| and his gang’s menacing threats. See Exh. 4, Tab D §¥ 21-22 (noting that government strategies to combat gang and gender-based violence are typically short-lived); Tab E {¥ 28-30; Tabs Y, KK. ‘This conclusion is consistent with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Alvarez-Lagos, which was based on a consideration of both the applicant's political opinion and the fact that she lived in a violent, gang-controlled territory. For the above-stated reasons, the Lead Respondent has demonstrated a presumed well founded fear of future persecution based on imputed political opinion. She is therefore statutorily eligible for asylum. iv. Discretion An applicant must also demonstrate that, in the totality of the circumstances, she merits a favorable exercise of discretion. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. 467, 473 (BIA 1987). A well- founded fear of persecution “should generally outweigh all but the most egregious adverse ‘inthe Matters o AE factors.” Id. at 474; Zuh_v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 504, 507-14 (4th Cir. 2008) (noting that discretionary denials are “exceedingly rare” and require egregious negative activity by the applicant). “The only negative factor in the Lead Respondent's case is the unlawful manner in. which she attempted to come into the United States. However, this negative factor is greatly outweighed by the demonstrated danger of future persecution that she would face if removed to El Salvador. See Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. at 473. Accordingly, | will grant her asylum application in the exercise of discretion. IV. CONCLUSION ‘The Lead Respondent has demonstrated past persecution and a presumed well-founded fear of future persecution on account of imputed political opinion. Her application for asylum under INA § 208(a) will be granted as a matter of discretion. N's derivative application for asylum is also granted. Because the Respondents’ asylum applications are granted, it is not necesséry to consider their applications for withholding of removal under the Act or for protection under the CAT.

DECISION AND ORDER APPEARANCES ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: ON BEHALF OF THE DHS: Benjamin G. Messer Brian J, Sandberg Yacub Law Office Assistant Chief Counsel 12761 Darby Brook Court, Suite 102 U.S. Department of Homeland Security Woodbridge, VA 22192 31 Hopkins Plaza, Suite 1600 4 Baltimore, MD 21201 IEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER I. Procedural History, ‘The Respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador, On August 8, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), which alleged that: (1) the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States; (2) he is a native and citizen of El Salvador; (3) he arrived at or near the Roma, Texas, port of entry on or about June 5, 2016; (4) he did not then possess or present a valid immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document; and (5) he was not then admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Based on the foregoing allegations, the NTA charged the Respondent with removability pursuant to INA § 212(a)(7A)G)(). The Court found the Respondent's removability to be established by clear and convincing evidence. The Respondent submitted a Form 1-589, Application for Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and Relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). “He testified in support of his application at an individual hearing on January 3, 2020. The Respondent, through counsel, argues that he is eligible for relief becausé he experienced past persecution on account of his actual or imputed political opinion when he resisted the demands of MS-13 gang members. Evidence Presented A. Documentary Evidence + Exhibit 1, Respondent's Notice to Appear. ‘© Exhibit 2, Respondent's Form 1-870, Record of Determination/Credible Fear Worksheet. ‘+ Exhibit 3, Respondent’s Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. ‘+ Exhibit 4, Tabbed A-G, Respondent’s Supporting Documentation. B. Testimonial Evidence ‘The Respondent testified that he came to the United States from El Salvador because members of the MS-13 gang threatened him. He explained that, on October 13, 2015, gang members first demanded that he pay a “rent.” He then began paying $100 to the gang members on the thirteenth and twenty-eighth day of every month. On April 28, 2016, gang members threatened the Respondent for the first time. The Respondent 2 ‘was on a bus when three gang members approached him, They told him that they wanted him to cooperate with them by providing information about everyone in his community. He responded that he needed some time to think it over. . The gang members gave him seven days to give them an answer, but told him that if he did not collaborate with them, they would harm his child or his child’s mother. The Respondent never gave the gang members a response. Following the incident, he told a friend what had happened and went to a police station in Sonsonate, a town about two hours away from where he lived, to file a police report, He said that there is a police station in his town, but the gang members who threatened him told him that they had informants in that station, In Sonsonate, the police officer who took the Respondent's report admitted that there were gang members within police ranks and advised the Respondent to leave the country. Several days later, the Respondent had another encounter with the gang members. The Respondent ‘was walking near his home at about 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. when six gang members gathered around him. One put a gun to the Respondents head and forced him to the ground, They asked why he ‘was not taking them seriously and told him that he had to collaborate or they would kill him, his child, and his child’s mother. ‘They then beat him on his stomach: After the beating, one of the members told him that he should be thankful to God that he was still alive and that he was going to be given a second chance. He told the Respondent that he had until May 7, 2036; to provide all the requested information, ‘The Respondent replied that he would do what they asked. The gang members told him that he had to wait one or two minutes to get up or else they would shoot him, They then left as the Respondent was lying face down. ‘The Respondent said that he left El Salvador on May 6, 2016, one day before the deadline. He believes that there is nowhere in El Salvador where he could safely live because the country is small and gang members could easily locate him, He noted that young people would likely report him to the gang for a small amount of money. No one can protect him, not even the police because alot of them are also gang members. On cross-examination, the Respondent was asked why his asylum application stated that he had been paying extortion for around three years when he testified that he had only paid it for about six months, The Respondent replied that hievdid not know why\""his applicatibn said that and reiterated that he began paying rent on October 13, 2015, He explained that he was due to make a rent payment on April 28, 2016, but the gang members told him that they no longer needed it. Instead, they said that they needed him to collaborate with them, The gang members wanted the Respondent to give them information about his neighbors, such as when they left for work, where they worked, and their means of living. The Respondent said that they planned to use this information to charge his neighbors rent. The Respondent knew this information, but never gave it to the gang members, ‘When asked if the gang members only wanted the information one time, the Respondent explained that they wanted him to collaborate with them, They told him that they might want him to collect the rent, They also wanted to use the Respondent’s home for their own purposes. The Respondent understood their demand to mean that they wanted him to become a member of thé gang, The Respondent stated that the gang has not harmed anyone in his family. His son and his son’s mother are in the United States. The Respondent’s siblings and parents are in El Salvador, but they have not experienced serious problems in the country. They do not live in the town where the Respondent lived. TI. Statement of the Law A. Asylum An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that he or she meets the definition of a refugee under INA § 101(a)(42)(A), which defines a refugee in part as an alien who is unable or unwilling to retum to her home country because of persecution, or a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, o political opinion. 8 C.F.R. § 1208:13(a); INA § 208(b)(1)(B). The’applitant’s fear 6f persecution must be country-wide. Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 211, 235 (BIA 1985). Additionally, applicants must establish that they are unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their couniry of nationality.or last habitual residence, INA § 101(a)(42)(A); Mulyani v, Holder, 771 F.3d 190, 199-200 (4th Cir. 2014). When the alleged persecutor is a private actor, the applicant also bears the burden of showing that his or her government was “unable or unwilling to control” the persecutor. Orellana v, Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 151 (4th Cir. 2019). An applicant who establishes statutory eligibility for asylum still bears the burden of demonstrating that a grant of asylum as a matter of discretion is warranted. INA § 208(b)(1). As a preliminary matter, an applicant for asylum must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application within cne year after the date of his arrival in the United States or by April 1, 1997, whichever is later. INA § 208(a)(2)(B); 8 CAR. § 1268.4(a)(2). This deadline may be excused if the applicant demonstrates either “changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant’s eligibility” for relief or “extraordinary cireumstances relating to the delay in filing...” INA § 208(a)(2)(D). In either instance, the applicant must apply within a reasonable period given the changed or extraordinary circumstances. 8 C.FR. § 1208.4(a)(4)- (5). The applicant has the burden of proving that he did not intentionally create these circumstances, that exceptional circumstances were “directly related” to his failure to apply within one year, and “that the delay was reasonable under the circumstances.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5). months after the occurrence of changed or extraordinary circumstances is Applying within si presumptively reasonable, but a delay over six months may be unreasonable, 65 FR 76121, 76123- 24 Wee. 6, 2000). “Changed circumstances” include, but are not iimited to: (1) changes in the applicant’s country of nationality or; if the applicant is stateless, country of last habitual residence; (2) changes in the applicant’s eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place an applicant at risk; or (3) the termination of a relationship that qualified an applicant as a dependent on another's pending asylum application, including attainment of age 21 by the dependent. 8 CFR. § 1208.4(@)(4)G)(A)(C). “Extraordinary circumstances” include, but are not limited to: (1) serious illness or mental or physical disability; (2) legal disability; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) maintenance of temporary protected status, lawful immigrant or non-immigrant status, or having received parole, until a reasonable period before the filing of the application; (5) filing an asylum application before the one-year deadline which was rejected as not properly filed and was re-filed within a reasonable 5 B period thereafter; or (6) the death or serious illness or incapacity of the applicant’s legal representative or a member of the applicant's immediate family. 8 CFR. § 1208.4(a)(5)(i)-(vi). Following a decision in Mendez Rojas v. Johnson, in a joint stay agreement, the Government has agreed to treat pending asylum applications by applicants in four classes as though they were filed within the one-year deadline, 305 F. Supp. 34 1176 (W.D. Wash., Mar. 29, 2018). Class A.II includes individuals who have been released from the DHS’s custody after having been found to have a credible fear of persecution, did not receive notice from the DHS of the one-year deadline, filed an asylum application after one year, and are in removal proceedings. Jd. at 1179. ii, Credibility and Corroboration An applicant bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion in connection with any asylum, application pursuant to INA § 208. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a), The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has recognized the difficulties an asylum applicant may face in dbtaining documentary or other corroborative evidence to support a claim of persecution, Matter of Dass, 20 I&N Dee. 120, 124 (BIA 1989). As a result, uncorroborated testimony that is credible, persuasive, and specific may be sufficient to sustait the burden of proof to establish a claim for asylum. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)Gi); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a); Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439, 445 (BIA 1987) ili, Past Persecution In order to establish a claim for either asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that the feared harm constitutes persecution under the INA. The BIA interpreted “persecution” to include serious threats to an individual’s life or freedom, or the infliction of, significant harm on the applicant, as a means of punishing that person for holding a characteristic that the perseoutor seeks to overcome, Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222. To establish past persecution, applicants must demonstrate thit they suffered persecution in thier country of nationality of} if stateless, in the country of last habitual residence, oxi account of an actual or imputed protected ground, and that they are unable or unwilling to return to, or avail themselves of the protection of, that country because of such persecution, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). Not every act of discrimination or harassment rises to the level of persecution, as persecution is “an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive.” Li v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, considering the aggregate effect of all the incidents to which a respondent has been subjected, the cumulative treatment may rise to the level of persecution. Baharon v, Holder, 588 F.3d 228, 232-33 (4th Cir, 2009); Matter of O-Z- and I-Z-, 22 I&N Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998). An applicant who fails to present a credible basis for a claim of past persecution may nevertheless prevail on a theory of future persecution, iv. Well-founded Fear of Future Persecution If an applicant demonstrates past persecution on account of a protected ground, he or she will benefit from a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 E.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). The DHS can rebut the presumption by showing that the applicant's fear is no longer well-founded due to a fundamental change in circumstances or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to require him or her to do so, 8 C.E.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)- Gi). Ifan applicant has not met the burden of demonstrating past persecution, the applicant bears the burden to show a well-founded fear of future persecution by a preponderance of the evidence. Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir. 2004), A well-founded fear of persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 430-31 (1987). To Hicet this standesd, an applicant must possess a subjective fear and must also demonstrate that “a reasonable person in similar circumstaiices would fear persecution on account of” one or more of the protected grounds, Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 272, 284 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing Cruz-Diaz v, INS, 86 F.3d 330, 331 (4th Cir. 1996); 8 CFR. §1208.13(b)(1)-(2). v ‘Nexus: Applicants for asylum must also'demonstrate that the persecution they fear would be inflicted “on account of” their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, 8 CFR. § 1208.13(6)(2)()(A), Even treatment that is regarded as “morally reprehensible” is not “persecution” within the meaning of the INA unless it occurs “on account of” one of the five enumerated grounds. Matter of T-M-B-, 21 I&N Dec. 775, 777 (BIA 1997). In essence, applicants must demonstrate that their race, religion, nationality, particular social group, or political opinion would be “at least one central reason” for the persecutor’s actions. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992). vi. Protected Ground— Political Opinion To demonstrate persecution on account of political opinion, applicants must show that their Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 235. Applicants can prove their political opinion with “evidence of verbal or openly ical beliefs or activ: persecutors have targeted them because of their polit expressive behavior ... in furtherance of a protected cause.” Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir, 2005), Alternatively, “persecution for ‘imputed” grounds (e.g., where one is erroneously thought to hold particular political opinions or mistakenly believed to be a member of religious sect) can satisfy the ‘refuugee” definition.” Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486, 489 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of A-G-, 19 I&N Dec. 502, 507 (BIA 1987)), Even if a respondent did not actually hold a political opinion, “in determining whether persecution existed on account of, political opinion, we focus on whether the persecutor has attributed a political view to the victim and acted on that attribution.” Singh v, Gonzales, 406 F.3d 191, 196 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing Sangha y, INS, 103 F.3d 1482, 1489 (9th Cir, 1997)). B, Withholding of Removal Pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must demonstrate that his or her “life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” INA § 241(b)(3). Specifically, applicants must establish that i subject to persecution if returned to the country from which they claim protection, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(j); INS v, Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 423. ‘An applicant who fails to demonstrate the well-founded fear of persecution required for asylum is more likely than not that they will be will necessarily fail to meet the higher burden of proof required for withholding of removal. Mirisawo v, Holder, 599 F.3d 391, 396 (4th Cir, 2010); Camara v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir. 2004) C. Convention Against Torture To be extended protection under the CAT, an applicant must establish that it is “more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed couritry of removal.” 8 C.ER. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.17(a); Matter of M-B-A-, 23 I8®N Dec. 474, 477-78 (BIA 2002). “Torture” is defined in part as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 8 CFR. § 1208.18(@)(1). Acquiescence of a public official requires that the official has awareness of or remains willfully blind to the activity constituting torture, prior to its commission, and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to injervene to prevent such activity, 8 CER. § 1208.18(@)(7); Suarez-Valenzuela v. Holder, T14 F.3d 241, 245-46 (4th Cir. 2013). The BIA has specified that only “extreme formfs] of cruel and inhuman treatment” rise to the level of torture, Matter of J-E-, 23 1&N Dec. 291, 297-99 (BIA 2002). In assessing a claim under the CAT, the Court must consider “all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture” and cannot rely solely on an adverse credibility determination to deny relief, Camara, 378 F.3d at 361. A claim under the CAT is analytically distinct from an asylum claim, Findings concerning the likelihood of a future occurrence and the future conditions a respondent is likely to face are factual findings, and whether future events and conditions satisfy the legal definition of torture is a legal question. Turkson v. Holder, 667 F.3d 523, 529-30 (4th Cir. 2012). IV. Findings of the Court Alll evidence has been reviewed, even if not specifically referenced: in this decision. The Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that his political opinion was or would be at least one central reason for the persecution he suffered or fears, or that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to El Salvador. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(); 8 CFR. § 1208.18(a)(7), A. Asylum i, Timeliness ‘Asa preliminary matter, the Respondent did not file his application within one year of entering the United States, He entered the United States on June 5, 2016, but did not file his asylum application until August 6, 2018. The parties, however, agree that the Respondent is a class joint stay agreement, 305 F. Supp. 3d 1176 (W.D. Wash., Mar 29, 2018). Accordingly, his application will be treated as though it were timely filed: fi, Credibility Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Respondent is credible, INA § 208(6(1)(B)(ii). His testimony was internally consistent and consistent with his asylum application and written statement, It was also consistent with what he told an asylum officer during his credible fear interview. The Respondent’s candid demeanor throughout his testimony also supports a finding that he is credible, Further, he supplied letters from friends and family members, in addition to country conditions evidence, which corroborate his account: iii, Past Persecution ‘The Respondent experienced harm that rises to the level of persecution. The Respondent testified that gang members pointed a gun to his head and beat him after he did not “collaborate” with the gang. Following the beating, the gang members gave the Respondent one more chance to collaborate with them, and they threatened to kill him, his child, and his child’s mother if he did not do so, This credible death threat alone qualifies as harm sufficiently severe to constitute past persecution. Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (death threats alone can qualify as harm severe enough to constitute persecution); Tairou v. Whitaker, 909 F.3d 702, 707-08 (4th Cir. 2018). In the aggregate, the physical abuse that the Respondent suffered and the death threat he received rise to the level of persecution, Baharon, 588 F.3d at 232-33. iv. On Account of Political Opinion ‘The Respondent argues that the harm and death threats he experienced occurred on account of his actual or imputed political opinion. The Fourth Circuit recently recognized that an individual's resistance to gang demands may constitute an imputed political opinion that would serve as a cognizable basis for relief, Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 251 (remanding for the BIA to determine if the gang imputed a political opinion to the téspondent). Although the BIA in Marter of S-E-G- noted that resisting gang recruitment does not generally constitute a political opinion, it did not analyze political opinions that gang members may impute to those who resist recruitment, 24 [&N Dec, $79, 589 (BIA 2008) (noting only that the respondents in that case “provided no evidence, 10 direct or circumstantial, that the MS-13 gang in El Salvador imputed, or would impute to them, an anti-gang political opinion”). The U.S. Supreme Court in Elias-Zacarias also did not bar imputed political opinion cases arising out of gang recruitment, noting simply there was no indication in that case “that the guerrillas erroneously believed that Elias-Zacarias’ refusal was politically based.” 502 U.S. at 482. Notably, the Fourth Circuit reiterated that an applicant's eligibility for asylum is “a feet-intensive inquiry” that requires substantial engagement with the record. Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 255 n.4, The Court must examine carefully this particular record to determine if gang members imputed a political opinion to the Respondent when they attacked and threatened him, Country conditions evidence shows that gangs have become “de facto government{s]” in Bl Salvador, which rival or replace legitimate political entities in the country. Exh, 4, Tab F at 161, 260. According to the U.S. State Department’s 2018 Human Rights Report for El Salvador, major gangs in the country exercise control over their own territories, Exh, 4, Tab D at 57. Within these temitories, gangs take on some of the fumetions of legitimate government. For example, gangs have reportedly created checkpoints at the border of their territory to control who may enter. Exh, 4, Tab E at 85. They detain individuals and ask them for identification documentation. Exh. 4, Tab F at 162, Gangs enforce curfews and have ordered stoppages to bus transit. Jd, Gang members also believe that théy, rather than legitimate law enforcement, take on the role of protecting individuals in their territory, and they charge fees for that protection, Jd. at 163, 208- 213, El Salvador’s president recently acknowledged this reality, telling a reporter that gangs “have ade facto power, areal one.” Exh, 4, Tab G at 332, He added that gangs “charge taxes” and “have aquasi-security foree.” Id. Gangs view a wide range of conduct as “resistance” to their claimed political authority over a temitory. Exh, 4, Tab E at 102, 126, This includes refusing to participate in their activities, refusing to join the gang, and reporting gang activity to the police. Jd. People who resist a gang’s “authority” are “subjected to swift and brutal retaliation from the gang.” /d. at 85-86. Punishment for their resistance can range from threats to death. Exh. 4, Tab E at 103; Tab F at 183, 208. ‘This evidence mirrors the Respondent's experience in E] Salvador. MS-13 gang members ordered u the Respondent to “collaborate” with them by providing information about his neighbors. When he did not respond to their demand, the gang members responded swiftly by beating him and threatening to kill him, his child, end his child’s mother. AAs the evidence above indicates, the gang members viewed the Respondent's reluctance to collaborate as resistance to their claimed authority. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR”) notes that individuals in such a situation “may be in need of intemational refugee protection on the grounds of their (imputed) political opinion.” Exh, 4, Tab E at 103, While the Respondent did not openly express a political opinion, gang members believed that he held an opinion in opposition to their political authority because he did not comply with their demands. In essence, gang members in this case imputed a political opinion fo the Respondent and harnied him because of that opinion. Accordingly, the Respondent has established that he experienced past persecution on account of an imputed political opinion. Having shown that he experienced past persecution on account of a protected ground, the Respondent benefits from a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 CFR. § 1208.13(6)(1). ‘The DHS has not rebutted that presumption. v, Government Unwilling or Unable to Protect Because the gang members who threatened the Respondent were private actors, the Respondent must show that the governinent would be “unwilling or unable to control [his] persecutor.” Orellana, 925 F.3d at 151. In this case, the Respondent attempted to report the threats he received from gang members to the police. Exh. 4, Tab B at 28, When he went to the police station, however, an officer admitted that there were gang members within the police ranks and suggested that the Respondent leave the country. The Respondent's experience is consistent with country conditions evidence in the record, which suggests that the government of El Salvador is woefully inadequate at controlling gang threats or violence. Exh. 4. The UNHCR notes that in certain parts of El Salvador, “the Government has lost effective control to gangs or other organized criminal groups and is unable to provide protection to civilians.” Exh. 4, Tab E at 116. Another report indicates that “Salvadoran state authorities consistently fail to aid families or individuals in preventing displacement, show indifference to the plight of vietims of violence, and tum their backs on their citizens.” Exh, 4, Tab F at 240, In fact, 68 percent of individuals who reported 12 being victims of extortion in one survey said that authorities “had done nothing to investigate the crime.” Jd, Additionally, the record shows that weakness and corruption within law enforcement has led to high levels of impunity in the country. Exh. 4, Tab E at 96. Gangs also “have their own infiltrators in the police and the military.” Exh. 4, Tab E at 96; Tab F at 183. Given this evidence, the Respondent has demonstrated that the government would be “unwilling or unable to control [his] persecutor.” Orellana, 925 F.3d at 151-52. B, Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT Since the Respondent will be granted asylum under INA § 208, the Court will not reach the merits of his claims for withholding under INA § 241(b)(3) or for relief pursuant to the CAT, as asylum is a greater benefit. INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24 (2006) (noting that “courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”. V. Conclusion ‘The Respondent demonstrated that he suffered past persecution on account of his imputed political opinion and has demonstrated that Salvadoran authorities are unwilling or unable to protect him. ‘The DHS has not rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. Thus, the Respondent's application for asylum is granted.

Documentary Evidence Exhibit 1: NTA for‘sieaimiaimip filed June 1, 2015; Exhibit 1A: NTA for Magu filed June 1, 2015; Exhibit 2; Form 1-589 and Supporting Documents, including Tabs B-D,! filed February 25, 2016; Exhibit 3: Additional Documents in Support of Form I-589, including Tabs E-F, filed August 24, 2016; Exhibit 4: luuautimis Sworn Statement, filed Septémber 26, 2017; Exhibit 5: Additional Documents in Support of Form 1-589, including Tabs G-M, filed October 15, 2019; and Exhibit 6: Nasimaiuaiie, Statement on Qualifying Particular Social Groups, filed October 15, 2019? B, Testimonial Evidence On October 29, 2019, the Court heard testimony from Masiiaimie The testimony provided in support of her applications for relief, although considered by the Court in its entirety, is not fully repeated herein as it is already part of the record. Rather, her testimony is summarized below to the extent it is relevant to the subsequent analysis. (Gimmie was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and was twenty-six years old at the time of her individual hearing. She and her partner, Sia.) have two children together: SMW, who was six years old at the time of the individual hearing, and SE 2 US. citizen who was one year old. SURMNMMMs mother and two sisters still reside in Honduras, insist filed Exhibit 2, with her Form 1-589 marked as Tab A, at a master calendar hearing on February 25, 2016, Ex.2, Tab A. However, the presiding immigration judge at that hearing inadvertently failed to stamp the Form 1-589 to indicate that she filed it on that date. Thus, the Court here notes that Mimimidaw timely filed her Form 1-589 on February 25, 2016, as the audio recording of proceedings in this matter clearly reflects, despite the fact the document bears a stamp indicating she filed it on August 24, 2016. See INA § 208(a)(2)(B). 7 ‘he Court mere AA Sistment on Qualf¥ing Particular Socal Groups fr identification purposes only as it is not evidence, but rather legal argument. See Ex. 6. Page 2 of 16 ate eememvepENITTennas emsiitie Prior to departing Honduras, Sati attended liigh school and worked in the accounting department at Imagen Global, a company that manufactured billboards. Around 2012, when she was eighteen years old, she met a man named deagediaummimatiatiieagaitgminene claimed to be very well connected, wealthy, and powerful; he was related to the owners of Imagen Global, as well as Natividad’s landlord. mimagaig parents owned their own company called Cable Sula, which supposedly provided cable and internet services. However, those services were merely a fagade for their criminal enterprises, including money laundering and drug trafficking schemes, See harassed MeN at work nearly every day, telling her that he so frequently visited the company because he wanted to see her. He told her that he desired to date her because she was an attractive “chick,” unlike the other women he “had before.” When she rejected his advances, he claimed that “nobody says no” to him and, if she did not oblige, he would “do it the bad way.” He also bragged to Nasimalael about his family’s illicit dealings, encouraging her to work for his family because he could “profit” off her. He explained that his family paid the police for protection and impunity. When she declined to join his family’s black-market businesses, he repeated that “nobody says no” to him. Nevertheless, Smillie continued to reject his aggressive advances. One day, while ‘animale! waited in front of Imagen Global after work for her bus home, ‘Sqm approached her in his car. He pointed a gun at her and demanded that she enter the car, threatening to shoot her, She complied. He continued to point the gun at her as he drove the car to nearby secluded hills. He stopped the car, brandished a blade, and then raped her. He cut her multiple times, resulting in deep gashes on her arm, leg, and back. Afterwards, he left her in the street, and she hitchhiked home. As a result of the rape and beating, she was severely bruised, bloodied, and lacerated, - Two days after this rape, Jaggp and two other men approached lame at their home and threatened to kill him if he did not end his relationship with Mimi. Thereafter, one of Sami associates repeatedly and menacingly rode pest Mammals home on a motorcycle. @Allajom recognized the associate, as he had previously approached her at a store and told her that she was going to receive “alittle surprise” from Sr Following the abuse, MINIM filed a police report against @age. However, she was hesitant to do so because the Honduran police are corrupt and only protect affluent individuals, As she reported (gage abuse, the police officer who took the report asked her whether she knew what she was “getting into” when she identified @jjugggas the perpetrator. She felt compelled to omit or distort certain details of the event in order to mitigate any retaliation that could arise from her complaint, as dicated his family bribed the police for protection and impunity. For example, she inaccurately told the police officer that grad abandoned her. She also declined to explicitly mention that taggggpraped her and instead only claimed that he “touched” her, While she was at the police station, the police officer input Sqqgi/s name into the police database, which revealed multiple complaints against him related to his mistreatment of other women. Subsequently, SIM forcibly entered ANNB's home and kidnapped her. He forced her into a car and, accompanied by three other men and a Woman, brought $l to an unknown location. He held her there for about three days and repeatedly raped her. ‘The other men and ‘woman watched as he raped her. He cursed at her and beat her, punching and kicking her face and head. He reminded her that he told her he would ‘do things the bad way” if she did not “accept” Page 3 of 16 Pa aman ad him. He threatened to kill Mammut, and, eventually, the woman helped to convince dame 10 allow @dmmimiiad to leave, ° ‘Thereafter, (MMB left her home to seek protection at various other locations. She moved to her mother’s home in Loma Larga, San Antonio de Cortes, Honduras, about three hours away from her home. She stayed there for a few days, before moving to a friend's home in Siguatepeque, Comayagua, Honduras. She also spent some time at a hospital during and after Gapmmnis birth. Meanwhile, Sp sent her text messages indicating that he was looking for her and intended to Kill her, He also repeatedly called her, as well as Sib, and posted threatening messages on her Facebook page; for example, he claimed'that he was going to find her and kill her “wherever” she was, referring to her as a “bitch.” She believes he was searching for her in order to traffic her to Guatemala and force her to join his prostitution and drug distribution businesses, Shortly thereafter, she fled Honduras, In May 2015, SQM entered the United States with jgmmge. Immigration officials apprehended her and Sjjqpe upon their arrival. Although documents filed by DHS suggest ‘Mamita told immigration officials she did not fear return to Honduras, she claimed that she did indeed state a fear of harm upon her retum due to the ablise she suffered, as well as the rampant crime in the country. Nevertheless, the immigration officials allegedly responded to her claim with rebufis, retorting that “all immigrants lie” and provide the same narrative underlying their requests for protection. After her arrival, SIMI leamed that S¥jgy was murdered. She fears returning to Honduras because of the abuse she suffered and lack of government protection she was provided. Every time she looks at the scars on her body, she remembers the times #qN¥ raped her and beat her. On two occasion, she unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide. Six months prior to the individual hearing in this matter, JMNM\"" sister received threatening text messages, menacingly asserting that {MIB would soon return to Honduras. Honduras is rife with crime and corruption and the authorities do not protect women, in part due to cultural machismo, Sala believes that, regardless of where they lived in the country, the government would not protect her or her children from violence. Indeed, multiple members of ‘MEMB: family have been murdered. Men wearing police uniforms murdered pregnant sister-in-law. §SMMMINNNIS father was also murdered. The police neither performed an autopsy on her father nor pursued any suspects of the twg murders. For those reasons, 5 requests protection in the United States. Tl. LAW, ANALYSIS, AND FINDINGS The Court has reviewed all evidence and testimony in the record, even if not specifically addressed in this decision, and has given the evidence appropriate weight. See generally Orellana y, Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 153 (4th Cit. 2019); Alvarez Lagos v, Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 251 (4th Cit. 2019). . A. Credibility and Corroboration When an applicant offers testimonial evidence to support an application for relief, the Court must assess credibility. See INA § 240(c)(4)(B). The REAL ID Act of 2005 governs the credibility analysis for cases in which the applicant filed for relief on or after May 11, 2005. Matter Page 4 of 16 | ee Of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42, 42-43 (BIA 2006). In making a credibility determination, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors. INA § 240(c)(4)(C); see Matter of J-Y-C., 24 T&N Dec. 260, 266 (BIA 2007), Generally, a witness must provide detailed, plausible, and consistent testimony. INA § 240(c)(4)(B). To be credible, the witness’s testimony should satisfactorily explain any material discrepancies-or omissions, INA § 240(c)(4)(C). A court may also base a credibility determination on a witness’s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness, and the inherent plausibility of the witness's account, Id Additionally, a court may consider the consistency between a witness's written and oral statements; the intemal consistency of each such statement; the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record; and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to’ whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the epplicant’s claim. Id. ‘An applicant also “bears the burden to provide réasonably available supporting evidence for material facts that are central to [her] claim,” and the absence of “corroborating evidence [can] lead to a finding that an applicant did not meet [her] burden of proof.” Matter of L-A-C-, 26 1&N Dec, 516, 519 (BIA 2015) (citing Matter of S-McJ-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 725-26 (BIA 1997). However, an applicant's own testimony, without corroborating evidence, may be sufficient proof to support an application if that testimony is believable, consistent, and detailed enough to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis for the fear of persecution. Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 439, 445 (BIA 1987); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a), Considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Court finds Geteamtamis testimony generally credible. See INA § 240(c)(4)(C). The Court notes some areas of concem, but finds that she satisfactorily explained them, or that they are too minor to warrant an adverse credibility finding, DHS did not explicitly contest the credibility of Saaammgpe testimony but did inquire as to certain inconsistencies in the record during cross-examination, Itis true that some of SUNIBNNINs testimony regarding the events occurring before and after the abuse she suffered were inconsistent with her written statements, For example, her declaration states that her landlord’s son introduced her to tgp, while she testified that she met ip at Imagen Global. Ex. 2, Tab B at 13. However, she credibly explained that @ggp was related to both her landlord and the owners of Imagen Global; thus, it is not inconceivable that she had interactions with (both by virtue of her employment at Imagen Global as well as through her relationship with her landlord. Additionally, the police report indicates that Iliad informed the police officers that i@gqumge had abandoned her after learning about the rape, while she testified that such abandonment never occurred. Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-36. Yet, this inconsistency is minor, and Nagin! adequately explained that she believed she needed to distort her account of the abuse to mitigate any possible retaliation arising from her contact with the authorities, in light of government corruption. Notably, moreover, she explained that $¥ggjB had connections with law enforcement and also explicitly threatened to kill IJINIWR. See also Ex. 5, Tab I at 221 (stating that §@ugr “had friends in the police”). Thus, it is plausible that {JUNNNNNMB! dishonestly informed the police that #¥gmml abandoned her in order to protect him fom Mp and his criminal associates. Such inconsistencies do not merit an adverse credibility finding, INA § 240(c)(4)(C). Finally, there were inconsistencies within WME s accounts of the repeated rapes and beating from which she suffered. However, it has long been documented that victims of severe Page 5 of 16 abuse often struggle to recall certain details of the trauinatizing events. Moreover, victims of sex crimes often suffer “from further trauma and embarrassment” when discussing the harm they suffered and, thus, may be reluctant to fully describe the abuse, instead providing different details during different retellings. Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk County, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982). Relatedly, DHS stipulated that qqutmiam could provide cursory testimony regarding the abuse she suffered in order to avoid retraumatization, “Wiliam also credibly explained that her descriptions of the attacks differed because of the emotional distress such retellings induce, Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the inconsistencies in *mmiagie testimony and written statements are excusable.* INA § 240(c)(4)(C). As such, the Court finds that Salil testified credibly. Her testimony generally provides a plausible, coherent, and sufficiently consistent and detailed basis for her claims. Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. at 445; 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a). It was also largely consistent with her Form 1-589 and the objective evidence in the record. See generally Ex. 2, Tab D at 24-124; Ex. 3, Tab F at 128- 88; Ex. 5, Tab M at 244-441, She was candid and forthright, even as to unfavorable facts. The Court observed her demeanor as she testified and did not‘identify any effort to obfuscate the truth in order to bolster her claims. Additionally, she was responsive to DHS’s questions and honestly attempted to address inconsistencies in the record. She also provided some corroborating evidence, including a declaration from her sister, the police report, and an article aboutdlmp. See Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-43. Accordingly, the Court finds (Mllmiés testimony both credible and generally corroborated. INA § 240(c)(4)(B). B. Asylum . To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate she is a “refugee” within the meaning of INA § 101(a)(42). INA § 208(b)(1)(BX(i). To satisfy the “refugee” definition, an applicant must demonstrate that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin because of a “well-founded fear” of future persecution on account of one of the five statutory grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(2)(42)(A). If an applicant establishes that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, then she benefits from a rebuttable presumption that she also has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.FR. § 1208.13(6)(1). An applicant must also establish that the persecution was or will be at the hands of the applicant’s government or a private actor the government is unwilling or unable to control. See Crespin- 7 See Robert Timothy Reagan, Scientific Consensus on Memory Repression and Recovery, 51 Rutgers L. Rev. 275 (1999); Sheree L. Toth & Dante Cicchetti, Remembering, Forgetting, and the Effects of Trawma on Memory: A Developmental Pochopatalogy Perspstive (1998; Maura Dougherty, Evaluating Recovered Memories of Trauma as Evidence, 25-IAN Colo. Law. I (1996). + With regard to the encounter between NNN and immigration officials at the border, the Court does not find thatthe contradictory statements allegedly made to them undercut the credibility of her statements in her testimony and declaration. Indeed, such interviews at ports of entry “are brief affairs given in the hous immediately following long and often dangerous journeys into the United Stats.” Qing Hua Lin, Holder, 736 F.3d 343, 352-53 (4th Cir. 2013). Mum testimony and demeanor also clearly show she genuinely fears retum to Honduras, notwithstanding the immigration officials’ record stating she did not express such a fear. The Court declines to comment on the proprity of any elleged derogatory statements made by the immigration officials and instead cites generally to SC-ER. § 2635.101 Page 6 of 16 OO Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir, 2011). The applicant also must demonstrate that one of the protected ground was or will be at least one central reason for her persecution, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)Gi). Finally, the applicant must show thaf the court should favorably exercise its discretion to grant asylum. INA § 208(b)(1)(A); 8 CER. § 1208.14(a), Wee claims that she suffered past persecution at the hands of @qagp and his criminal associates on account of her membership in the particular social group composed of “Honduran women.” See Ex. 6 at 5.° For the following reasons, the Court grants MINI asylum application. 1. Past Persecution Persecution within the meaning of the Act is harm surpassing the level of “mere harassment,” and occurring at the hands of the applicant's government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, on account of a protected ground. Li Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir, 2005) (quoting Dandan v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 567, 573 (7th Cir. 2003); Crespin. Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128; see Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). a. Harm Rising to the Level of Persecution “Persecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the refugee definition,” Bakaron v, Holder, 588 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Li, 405 F.3d at 177). In determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of persecution, the Fourth Circuit has observed that persecution is systematic, whereas less-severe mistreatment is generally limited to isolated incidents. Id. Thus, when the alleged mistreatment is in the form of brief-detentions, repeated interrogations, or “{mJinor beatings,” courts generally do not regard it as persecution. Li, 405 F.3d at 177 (quoting Kondakova v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 792, 797 (8th Cir. 2004)), In contrast, the Fourth Circuit has expressly held that “the threat of death alone constitutes persecution,” even without more, Tairow v, Whitaker, 909 F.3d 702, 707-08 (4th Cir. 2018); Hernandez-Avalos v, Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126); but see Cortez-Mendez v. Whitaker, 912 F.3d 205, 209 n, (4th Cir. 2019) (a death threat may not always rise to the level of persecution if itis too “distant,” “unspecific,” or remote in time and place). Rape may also rise to the level of persecution, See Matter of D-V-, 21 I&N Dec. 77, 79-80 (BIA 1993). A court must consider all of the threats and harm “[iJn the aggregate” to determine whether an applicant has suffered past persecution. Matter of O-Z- & I-Z-, 22 1&N Dec. 23, 25-26 (BIA 1998). ‘The Court finds Saasaitimg has established that she suffered past harm rising to the level of persecution. DHS does not argue otherwise, The éredible testimonial and documentary evidence in the record show that ijl kidnapped, repeatedly raped, and beat (NINN See Ex, 2, Tab B at 14, Such abuse constitutes persecutory mistreatment. D-V-, 21 I&N Dee. at 79-80. Jorge then . ‘WeemNNPEBN also argues that she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of other alleged protected grounds; however, for the sake of administrative efficiency, the Court declines to address those asserted grounds as MMMM has met her burden to show that she has a fear of future persecution on account of her membership in the cognizable social group composed of “Honduran women.” See INS v. Lopes. “Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040 (1984) (noting removal hearings “provide a streamlined determination of eligibility to remain inthis county\"") Page 7 of 16 niensereomnstinitintnnoreneseamnngsisapmeetibiattttlemiibs aitiaideeecaaatitataiy continually lodged credible threats—including death threats—against Natividad, which also constitute harm rising to the level of persecution. Tairou, 909 F.3d at 707-08; Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949; see also Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; Ex. 5, Tab Lat 221, Siqqgp and his associates’ persistent pursuit of Smmimimigab was not contained to isolated incidents; they repeatedly threatened to kill her, Geum, and QM, Baharon, 588 F.3d at 232; Ex. 2, Tab B at 15; Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. Thus, ‘iets has met her burden to establish past harm of sufficient severity to constitute persecution. Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128. b. Government Unwilling or Unable to Control An applicant for asylum must show she fears persecution by the government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950; Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222. Whether the government is unable or unwilling to control private actors must be determined on a case-by-case basis. See Crespin-Vatladares, 632 F.3d 117, 128-29 (4th Cir. 2011), “[T]he mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes . cannot itself establish an asylum claim.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 320 (A.G. 2018), abrogated on other grounds by Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F.Supp.3d 96 (D-D.C. Cir. 2018). Moreover, in Orellana v. Bare, the Fourth Circuit explained that an applicant's failure to report abuse “does not prove the availability of govemment protection.” 925 F.3d 145, 153 (4th Cir. 2019). Even if an applicant sought government protection, mere “access to a nominal or ineffectual remedy,” or “empty or token “assistance,” is not sufficient to establish that the government is able to control a private persecutor—a sepiirate and distinct question from whether itis willing to do so. Id. at 151-52 & n.3 (citing Rahimzadeh v, Holder, 613 F.3d 916, 921 (9th Cir. 2010). Finally, an applicant need not have persisted in secking goverment protection if doing so would have been futile or resulted in further abuse. Id. at 153 (citing Ornelas-Chavez v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2006)). The Court finds that Mawimimb has met her burden of proving that the Honduran government is unable or unwilling to protect her. Importantly, she credibly testified that she contacted law enforcement and filed a police report, a copy of which she provided to the Court. Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-36. She further explained that the police officer who documented her complaint asked her whether she knew what she was “getting into” when she identified Samp as the perpetrator. See also Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. In spite of her effort to report the abuse, the record suggests that the Honduran government took no action at all. Jd at 14-15; Ex. 5, Tab K at 230, DHS argues that, because &ialllMBl only filed one police report, whereas the petitioner in Orellana contacted law enforcement multiple times, the Gourt should find that Nwaimitl failed to show that the government is unwilling or unable to protect her, It further argues that she failed to ‘meet her burden because, when she did actually file a police report, she lied about the relevant events. First, the Court does not read into the relevant law any requirement regarding the number of police reports an asylum applicant must file to show that a government is unwilling or unable to control a persecutor. Indeed, an applicant is not required to show that she filed even one complaint, particularly if doing so would be futile or risk further abuse, Orellana, 925 F.3d at 153. Futility and risk were high in Nimiminmiés decision to report aijagyr she credibility testified that ‘Sump told her that his family bribed the police for protection and impunity, an assertion which is supported by his family’s elevated social status. See Ex. 5, Tab I at 221 (stating that Slg*had friends in the police”); id, Tab L at 239 (referring to JagggPas the son of “entrepreneurs” and Page 8 of 16 owners of Cable Sula); id, Tab M at 244 (noting “widespread government corruption” and impunity). Second, while it is true that Nasimiigg) did not accurately describe to the police the ‘traumatic abuse she suffered, her dishonesty was justified. AAs explained above, she distorted the relevant events in an attempt to mitigate any potential retaliation arising ftom her complaint, as well as to protect Jilmmip. 1d. at 233-34, Her reasonable decision to do so is supported by objective evidence showing government corruption, as well as her testimony that the officer who took the report suggested that reporting the abuse was unwise. Sée also Ex. 2, Tab B at 15; Ex. 5, Tab I at 221; id., Tab M at 239, 331. Nevertheless, regardless of the number of complaints SNMNMIWMfiled or the contents therein, she did report clearly criminal conduct to the police, yet the authorities took no action at all. See Ex. 5, Tab L at 233-34. Such inaction aligns with IMNlM’s credible testimony that Honduran law enforcement is corrupt and only protects wealthy individuals. In fact, “(t]he police force is reported to be one of the most corrupt and mistrusted in Latin America.” Id, Tab M at 331. For example, there have been “several reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawfal killings.” Id. at 245. Numerous government officials have also been exposed for their illicit dealings, including “attempted murder” and “premediated killings.” Id. at 246, Relatedily, many police officers have “faced prosecution or were convicted in the United States for involvement in organized crime.” Id, at 283, Nevertheless, such corruption in the government is “reported to continue to contribute to widespread impunity for crimes committed by members of drug smuggling structures.” Id at 332. Asa result of rampant crime and government comuption, “there are no areas in major urban cities fee of violent crime.” Id. at 286. Indeed, “[v}iolent crime is rampant in Honduras,” and women and girls in particular “face high levels of gender-related violence.” Id. at 283, 281. Passengers on public transportation are often raped, robbed, kidnapped, and murder. Id at 287, The corrupt government even struggles to control crime in its prisons, which are saturated with “pervasive gang-related violence.” Id. at 249. Moreover, abundant independent evidence in the record generally shows that “[o}tganized criminal elements,” such as those in which dg family and associates were involved, were “significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed acis of murder, extortion, kidnapping, torture, [and] human trafficking,” often targeting “members of vulnerable populations,” including “women.” Id. at 244, 247, 252, 263. Thus, the record reflects that the Honduran government does not merely “have problems” policing “certain crimes.” 4-B-, 27 I&N Dec, at 320. Instead, itis a significant part of the broader problem itself. See Ex. 5, Tab M at 405 (reporting that “{{Jhe Honduran government has been unable and unwilling to protect ‘women from various forms of violence through direct action, such as engaging in their persecution and killings”). Finally, while the record does show that some sectors of the government make some efforts to protect residents, “nominal or ineffectual’¥assistance is insufficient to demonstrate ‘that the government is willing or able to protect MMMM. Orellana, 925 F.3d.at 152, In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that S¥QNNNN99 has shown that the government of Honduras is unable or unwilling to protect her. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950. ¢. Membership in a Cognizable Particular Social Group An applicant for asylum alleging persecution orf-account of membership in a particular social group must show that she is a member of a cognizable “particular social group” within the Page 9 of 16 agg rrngpeemnsnensenrinrestientenommiemeeaness nn meaning of the Act. See INA § 101(a)(42)(A). A cognizable particular social group must be “(1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec, 227, 237 (BIA 2014); see Temu v. Holder, 740 F.3d 887, 892 (4th Cir. 2014). ‘Siento: argues that she suffered persecutory abuse on account of her membership in the particular social group composed of “Honduran women.” See Ex. 6 at 5. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes this is a cognizable particular social group under the Act, First, the Court finds Honduran women share an-immutable characteristio—the fact that they are Honduran women. One’s sex and nationality are so fundamental to identity that one should not be required to change them in order to avoid persecution. See Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 233 (recognizing that sex is an immutable characteristic); Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 366 (BIA 1996) (“The characteristic{] of being a ‘young woman’. . . cannot be changed.”); see also Perdomo v. Holder, 611 F.3d 662, 666-67 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2010); see also INA § 101(a)(42)(A) isting nationality, inter alia, as protected grounds). Accordingly, the Court finds that the group “Honduran women’ is comprised of members who share a common immutable characteristic, M- E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 237, ~ Next, the Court finds that the group “Honduran women” is defined with sufficient particularity. To satisfy the particularity requirement, a proposed group “must be defined by characteristics that"
,"provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group.” M-E- V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 239; accord Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253. “The group must also be discrete and have definable boundaries—it must not be amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective.” M-E-V-G-, 26 I8:N Dec. at 239; see also Zelaya v. Holder, 668 F.3d 159, 165 (4th Cir. 2012) (stating that a particular social group must “b8 defined with sufficient particularity to avoid indeterminacy”), “(T]he size and breadth of a group alone does not preclude a group from qualifying as [a particular] social group.” Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253 (quoting Perdomo, 611 F.3d at 669) (intemal quotation marks omitted); see also Reyes v, Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125, 1135 (9th Cir. 2016). This is in keeping with the other protected grounds in the statutory series—for example, there may be tens of millions of members of a certain race or religion in a given country, but this fact does not preclude any one of those members from qualifying for asylum if they can show persecution on account of race or religion, See INA § 101(a)(42)(A); see also M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 234 (applying the ejusdem generis canon of construction to construe the statutory phrase “membership in a particular social group” harmoniously with the other four protected grounds). Indeed, the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) has held cognizable numerous particular social groups that have a high number of members. See, e.g., Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. 819, 822- 23 (BIA 1990) (finding that the grouping of homosexuals in Cuba is sufficiently particular); Matter of H-, 21 I&N Dec. 337, 343 (BIA 1996) (concluding that memibers of the Marehan subclan in Somalia belong to a sufficiently particular group); Matter of V-T-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 792, 798 (BIA. 1997) (finding that Filipinos of mixed Filipino-Chinese ancestry are members of a sufficiently particular group). Moreover, a group need not have “an element of ‘cohesiveness’ or homogeneity among group members” for it to satisfy the particularity requirement. Matter of C-A-, 23 1&N Dec. 951, 957 (BIA 2006). Page 10 of 16 ere e ere nsanncemmansneRENEPSN OS. In Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, the Board ruled that “affluent Guatemalans” are not members of a cognizable particular social group, holding that “[iJhe terms ‘wealthy’ and ‘affluent? standing alone are too amorphous to provide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership.” 24 1&N Dec. 69, 74 (BIA'2007). In Temu, the Fourth Circuit commented that the group in A-M-E- & J-G-U-, “affluent Guatemalans,” was not defined with particularity “because the group changes dramatically based on who defines it.” 740 F.3d at 895, The Fourth Circuit explained that “[a]éfluent might include the wealthiest 1% of Guatemalans, or it might include the wealthiest 20%,” and that the group therefore “lacked boundaries that are fixed enough to qualify asa particular social group.” Id. Unlike the group “affluent Guatemalans,” the group “Honduran women” does not change based on who defines it, and therefore it has boundaries that are fixed enough to meet the particularity requirement. There is a clear and unambiguous benchmark to determine who is a member of the group—Honduran women are members; Honduran men and people of other nationalities are not, This is not a subjective or amorphous criterion, See Temu, 740 F.3d at 895, Nor do the size or internal diversity of the group “Honduran women” imply that the group is not particular, any more than the size or intemal diversity of the groups “homosexuals in Cuba” or “Filipinos of mixed Filipino-Chinese ancestry” defeated the particularity of those groups. Toboso- Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. at 822-23; V-T-S-, 21 I&N Dec. at 798; see Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253 (quoting Perdomo, 611 F.3d at 669) (noting that a large group can be particular); C-4-, 23 1&N Dec. at 957 (explaining that intra-group homogeneity or cohesiveness is not required). The group “Honduran women” is “at least as ‘particular and well-defined’ as other groups whose members have qualified for asylum,” such as “former gang members,” “the educated, landowning class of cattle farmers,” and “Iranian women who advocate women’s rights or who oppose Iranian customs relating to dress and behavior.” See Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 125 (collecting cases) ‘Therefore, the Court finds that the articulated group satisfies the particularity requirement. Finally, the Court finds that the group composed of “Honduran women” is socially distinct. ‘The social distinction inquiry tums on whether the proposed group is “perceived as a group by society”—specifically, “the society in which the claim for asylum arises.” M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 240-41. A group need not be ocularly visible to others in society for it to be socially distinct. Id, at 240. “Although the society in question need not be able to easily identify who is a member of the group, it must be commonly recognized that the shared characteristic is one that defines the group.” Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 217 (BIA 2014). The dispositive reference point in the social distinction analysis is the perception of the society in question, as ‘opposed to the perception of the persecutor. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 241-42. However, the perception of the persecutor “may be relevant, because it can be indicative of whether society views the group as distinct.” Jd. at 242, Evidence that is probative on the issue of social distinction may include “country conditions reports, expert witness testimony, and press accounts of discriminatory laws and policies, historical animosities, and the like.” Id. at 244-47, The fact that members of the proposed group are singled out for greater persecution than the general population is also “highly relevant” to the social distinction analysis, Temu, 740 F.3d at 894, YamMNBER! hes shown that women in Honduras are “set apart” and “distinct” from other persons in Honduras in “some significant way,” and are therefore socially distinct. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238. Generally, the record reflects that, because women in Honduras are seen as, subordinate to the rest of society, they are significantly set apart from the public at large. The Page 11 of 16 ee phenomena of machismo and marianismo, common cultural tenets widely held in Hondurans, give rise to the belief that women are inferior to men and must carry out certain subaltem societal roles. See Ex. 5, Tab M at 362, 369-70, 375. An inherent aspect of these principles is that “men can do anything they want to women in Honduras.” Id. 364. Although the social distinction requirement does not necessitate ocular visibility, the subordination of and violence against women in nearly omnipresent in Honduras. See, e.g, id. at 276, 278, 345-47, 405. Indeed, gender-based violence in Honduras is unavoidable—in the country itself and abroad; for example, only a few years prior to the issuance of this decision, a global beauty pageant contestant and her sister fell victim to femicide; “[t]heir joint funeral was broadcast around the world and attended by thousands.” Id. at 364. The sister was shot by her boyfriend “fbJecause ofthis machismo.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omitted). Such atrocious gender-based violence is commonplace and frequently published in the media. See, e.g., id at 404, Even when not reported in the media, the record reveals that the subordination of Honduran women—and violence against them—is inescapably perceptible. In fact, Honduras “has the highest recorded rate of femicide in Latin America, and also one of the highest rates of femicide among girls... in the world.” [dat 345, 404; Temu, 740 F.3d at 894 (explaining that whether a group “is singled out for greater persecution than the poptilation as a whole” is a “highly relevant factor” in determining social distinction). Such “widespread and systematic” violence against women and girls is carried out by a diverse array of members ofthe public, including “members of gangs and other organized criminal groups, the security services[,] and other individuals.” Id at 345, 244, 247. The ubiquity of the problems Honduran women face is only increasing, as there has been a “recent spiral of violence in the lives of women.” Jd. at 405. For example, one of the many forms of gender-based abuse, domestic violence, is widespread, “as is impunity for the perpetrators.” Id. at 347, “Large numbers of Honduran girls and women .... are also reported to be forced into prostitution in Honduras and trafficked info sex slavery in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, the United States{,] and elsewhere.” Jd at 346, The subordination of women results in obvious barriers to women’s fundamental participation in civil society, such as accessing adequate employment and voting in election, further setting them apart in the margins of society. Id. at 276, 278, 263; id. at 267 (noting that, notwithstanding that “the law accords women and men the same legal rights and status... , many women did not fully enjoy such rights”). Thus, the record clearly reflects that Honduran women are significantly set apart from Guatemalan society at large. As such, the Court finds that S¥qqiqiagpW's proposed group is sufficiently socially distinct, M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee. at 238, Accordingly, the Court concludes that Saai@MNBl is a meraber of the cognizable particular social group composed of “Honduran women.”* See INA § 101 (a)(42)(A). : ‘The notion that women in a given country can form a particular social group is not novel. As noted above, the Board stated in 1985 in Acosta that one’s “sex” is a “shared Eharacteristic” on which particular social group membership can be based. 19 I&N Dec. at 233. In Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth Circuit stated that “the ‘recognition that girls or women ofa particular clan or nationality (or even in some circumstances females in general) ‘may constitute & social group is simply a logical application of our law.” 400 F.3d 785, 797 (Sth Cir. 2003). In its 2010 decision in Perdomo v. Holder, the Ninth Circuit interpreted its Mohammed decision as “clearly acknowledgfing} that women in @ particular country, regardless of ethnicity or clan membership, could form a particular social group.” 611 F.3d 662, 667 (Sth Cir. 2010). Similarly, in Hassan v. Gonzales, the Bighth Cireuit found that “Somali females” are members of é particular social group. 484 F.3d $13, 518 (8th Cir 2007). In Fatin v. INS, the Third Circuit stated Page 12 of 16 | d. Nexus An asylum applicant must demonstrate that a protected ground, such as membership in a particular social group, was “at least one central reason” for the persecution she suffered or fears she would suffer. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dee. 208, 212-14 (BIA 2007). “The applicant need not prove that the protected ground was the central reason or even a dominant central reason for the persecution; she need only show that the protected ground was more than an incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate reason underlying the persecution.” Zavaleta-Policiano v. Sessions, 873 F.3d 241, 247 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009)) (intemal quotation marks omitted), In conducting the nexus analysis, court nfust consider not only the “articulated purpose” of a persecutor's threats, but also the “intertwined reasons” for those threats. Id. at 248 (quoting Cantillano Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 129 (4th Cir. 2017)). A court should consider both direct and circumstantial evidence of a persecutor’s motive, and is free to make reasonable inferences from that evidence. Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 40, 44 (BIA 2017), overruled in part on other grounds, 27 1&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019). ‘The Court finds aN has met her burden of proving that her status a Honduran woman was at least one central reason why damp and his associates targeted her. DHS argues that she failed to establish the requisite nexus because the record merely shows that gi was a stalker ‘who pursued her because he was obsessed with her. While DHS’s theory may be one part of the aggressors’ broader motive, the record clearly reflects that Natividad’s sex and inseparably attendant vulnerability was at least one central reason for the mistreatment. Zavaleta-Policiano, 873 F.3d at 247. Indeed, the evidence and testimony in this case establish that the abused suffered goes beyond a simple case of gender-based mistreatment within a personal relationship. See Velasquez v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 188, 195 (4th Cir. 207). AAs discussed above, there is a belief in Honduras that a man can “do anything” he wants toa women; thus, “[bJecause of his machismo,” he will willfully carry out horrific acts of abuse— on account of the fact that the victim is a Honduran woman is therefore largely helpless. Ex. 5, Tab M at 364. This gendered motivation is present gqgagmand his associates’ pursuit of amu, In fact, MENON credibly testified that law enforcement informed her thatalamge had engaged in such abuse before, revealing his awareness that he could harm Honduran women with impunity on account of the cultural gender bias in Honduran society. Ex, 2, Tab B at 15. Of course, this awareness was not at all misguided; indeed, the government took no action against dag, and he and his associates continued to pursue dias. Moreover, the language damm used when speaking todslasimitial evinces his gender-based motive and recognition of her perceived inferior status, repeatedly referring to her possessively and as a “bitch,” as well as asserting that he could mistreat her without punishment. Jd, at 13-15. Importantly, he also told her he could “profit” off her, again suggesting he targeted her because of her identity as a woman. It could be argued that dieeimtoen’ ras targeted in order to enrich the Canahuati criminal enterprise, but her status as a Honduran woman is inextricably intertwined with any such motive, as the record clearly shows that, under Acosta, “to the exten that the petitioner in this case suggests that she would be persecuted or has a well- founded fear that she would be persecuted in Iran simply because she is a woman,” she has articulated a cognizable particular social group. 12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993). This Court is aware of no precedential opinion of the Board or of any circuit court holding that a group made up of all the women in a given country cannot bea particular social group. Page 13 of 16 ‘ that her sex was a crucial factor in daags's and his associates’ decision to pursue her. Zavaleta- Policiano, 873 F.3d at 247. Based on the foregoing, the record clearly corroborates the notion that Wettmend his associates pursued dasamsa because of her identity, as it demonstrates that women in Honduras are widely subject to unpunishable mistreatment due to their subordination to men. See, ¢.g., Ex. 5, Tab M at 263, 276, 278, 345-47, 362, 364, 404-05, As such, the Court finds that Masiiiml has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one central reason $4 and his criminal associates targeted her, rather than another person, is that she is Honduran woman. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949-50. Therefore, the Court concludes that she has demonstrated the requisite nexus. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(). 2, Rebuttable Presumption of Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Because dimiwtwnl has demonstrated that she suffered past persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, she benefits from a rebuttable presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 CFR. § 1208.13(6)(1). DHS bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that, infer alia, there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that she no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in Honduras on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b\\1)@(A)-(B). DHS argues thatelaaga's death is a fundamental change in circumstances that rebuts the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Itis true thatslmmge, one of the aggressors ‘who pursued, has died. Ex, 5, Tab L at 238-43. However, the record shows that multiple criminal associates affiliated withdamg and his family likewise pursuede@mimiim, Indeed, dmg informedestanmitims that “his family has orders to kill” her and his bodyguards were searching for her. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14-15, She also credibly explained that his family is well connected and powerful. Ex. 5, Tab I at 222. qqmgp threateningly assétted that he had “a lot of friends in the police” and that his boss, a high-ranking drug trafficker, would target @aWimillmi, Ex. 5, Tab I at 221-22; Ex. 2, Tab B at 14-15. His associates also made their presence known in the lives of eM: family. For example, suspicious cars and a motorcycle frequently drove by Samia home, Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. Importantly, moreover, amma sister has received numerous threatening phone calls from “various numbers,” as well as text messages. See Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. In fact, only two months prior to the individual hearing in this matter, iii sister received text messages that menacingly claimed that ddasimiaimd would soon return to Honduras, Similarly, ‘men recently approached gjmsiminimiis mother at her ‘business to inquire about dimtmiaienite whereabouts, asserting they will find Qigsiwtdmb because they have numerous “contacts” in Honduras. Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. Therefore, even thoughslage is deadgiimnimil would face abuse at the hands oféamgaigefamily and criminal associates if she were retumed to Honduras. As such, the Court finds DHS has not met its burden to prove a fundamental change in circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 3. Humanitarian Asylum In the alternative, the Court grantsqhiassmiimigs asylum application due to the severity of the past persecution she suffered. Even where an applicant might not be able to establish a well- Page 14 of 16 ——_—_—————— founded fear of future persecution, ifshe has established particularly severe past persecution, then 2 court may grant asylum in an exercise of its discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii\\(A); Matter of Chen, 20 1&N Dec. 16, 21 (BIA 1989). Under Fourth Circuit precedent, “[e]ligibility for asylum based on severity of persecution alone is reserved for the most atrocious abuse,” Naizgi v, Gonzales, 455 F.3d 484 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Gonahasa v. INS, 181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir-1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 1066, 1072 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that rape may constitute atrocious abuse to support a grant of humanitarian asylum). Thus, a court may only grant humanitarian asylum when the past persecution was “so severe that it would be inhumane to return the [applicant] even in the absence of any risk of future persecution.” Gonahasa, 181 F.3d at 544 (quoting Vaduva v, INS, 131 F.3d 689, 690 (7th Cir. 1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted), ‘The Court finds that@@WA@MIBH has established past persecution so severe that she merits a gant of humanitarian asylum, 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii)(A). The record reflects that she was kidnapped, violently raped, and brutally beaten multipte times. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; Garcia- Martinez, 371 F.3d at 1072. On at least one occasion, other people watched while she was raped. ‘The beatings to which she was subjected left her bruised and bloodied. She was cut multiple times on her arm, leg, and back. Following this abuse, she, S09 and@lagumm were threatened with death several times. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; see also Ex. 5, Tab Lat 221. When @9am-WN@al attempted to escape harm, her aggressors incessantly pursued her. Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. As a result of this repeated, prolonged abuse, @Aa™RGM suffers from severe emotional trauma. Jd She has twice attempted to commit suicide. She is constantly reminded of attacks she endured due to the scars left on her body. The Court observed her demeanor dufing the individual hearing and does not doubt that she suffered extreme, inhumane mistreatment that permanently affected her life. The severity of the abuse dimtiaiasl suffered is largely unparalleled by the harm discussed in Fourth Circuit decisions addressing requests for humanitarian asylum. In Naizgi, for example, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Board’s denial of humanitarian asylum, concurring that harm in the form of expatriation as well as the loss of livelihood and property was insufficient to warrant agrant of humanitarian asylum, 455 F.3d at 487. The atrocious abuse that iliaiméexperienced, resulting in her enduring trauma, is certainly more deplorable and depraved than the terrible mistreatment the petitioner in Naizgi suffered. Again, she was sequestered and repeatedly raped and beaten, resulting in lasting physical and emotional damage. Therefore, the Court concludes that this is such a case where the past persecution was so severe that it would be inhumane to remove @dauimiia to Honduras, even if there were an absence of a risk of future persecution, Gonahasa, 181 F.3d at 544, As such, the Court grants SIMgRiimis request for,humanitarian asylum in the altemative. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii)(A). IV. CONCLUSION ‘The Court concludes that dsimimaimiahas shown she faced past persecution on account of protected ground and, thus, benefits from the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution on the same basis. DHS has not rebutted that presumption. Therefore, the Court will Page 15 of 16 ————_—_— grant her application for asylum in an exercise of its discretion.” Alternatively, the Court finds that she warrants a grant of humanitarian asylum based on the severity of the past harm she experienced. As such, the Court also grants &S9NNHP8 derivative application for asylum, Accordingly, the Court enters the following order: t ORDERS It Is Ordered that: $e opp lication for asylum be GRANTED. Its Further Ordered that: @gmaw® derivative application for asylum pursuant to 8 CF.R.,§ 1208.21 be GRANTED. SAl102d gration Judge _) Date NWyme P. Kel APPEAL RIGHTS: Both parties have the right to appeal the decision in this case, Any appeal is due at the Board of Immigration Appeals on or before thirty (30) calendar days from the date of service of this decision. 2 Once an applicant has shown her statutory eligibility for asylum, a court must consider whether to grant or deny asylum in its discretion. 8 CFR. § 1208.14(@). The Fourth Circuit has recognized that discretionary denials of asylum are “exceedingly rare™ and require “egregious negative activity by the applicant.” Zvh . Mukasey, 547 F.3d 504, 507-14 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Huang v. INS, 436 F.3d 89, 92 2d Cir. 2006)) Nig merits a favorable ‘exercise of discretion. She has a well-founded fear of persecution in Honduras on account of membership in a particular social group. There is no evidence she has any criminal history or any previous violations of US. immigration law. Notably. QilaM80UHs removal would profoundly negatively affect the life of her both of her minor children: Hagman, a U.S. citizen who is curently two years old. Ex. 5, Tab J at 226, As detailed above, violence and crime is widespread in Honduras, so there is «high likelihood SNM and her children will fce harm. ‘Thus, @ grant of asylum would advance humanitarian interests. Under the totality ofthe circumstances, the Court concludes this is not the exceedingly rare case in which a discretionary denial of asylum is warranted.

They were thereafter placed in removal proceedings under Section 240 of the Act. Exhibit 1 The Respondents, through counsel. nowledged proper service of their Notices to Appear. Further, they have admitted to the factual allegations and the charge of removability contained therein. See Exhibit 1. Based on their admissions and concessions, this Court sustains the charge of removability. On September 20, 2016, the {MJ8A@)RESPONAEHDSubmitted a Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal and listed i and as derivatives. Exhibit 4, On (NOWEMBEFDZNZONBD the Court heard testimony from the Lead Respondent, the sole witness. On that date, the Immigration Judge raised concerns over the Lead Respondent's competency and asked the parties whether they wished the Court to make a competency determination in line with Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dee. 474 (BIA 2011). The Respondents counsel stated that they believed the Lead Respondent was competent to testify but requested certain safeguards. The Court deferred to counsel's judgment of his client's competency, and the parties stipulated that (1) the Lead Respondent's written declaration, as amended, would supplementiheptestimony for the purposes determining her credibility, see Exhibit 9, Tab A: and (2) the Respondent would not be asked to testify to the details of the four specifically-alleged incidents of rape. Further, during the individual hearing. the parties asked direct, simple questions of the Lead Respondent, and the Court permitted leading questions as necessary to aid the Lead Respondent in developing the record. The Court finds that the parties” stipulations, as well as the Respondents’ representation by highly competent and responsible counsel, were sufficient safeguards to ensure that the Respondent could meaningfully participate i moval proceedings. See 25 I&N Dee. at 479. Accordingly Withholding of Removal, under Section 241(b)(3), and protection under the CAT are NOT REACHED. EVIDENCE PRESENTED Documentary Evidence ‘The Court considered all documentary evidence submitted by the parties contained in the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.9. The evidentiary record contains the following documentary exhibits: Exhibit 1: Form I-862, Notice to Appear. filed July 12. 2016: Exhibit 2: Notice of Hearing, dated July 14, 2016; Exhibit 3: Notice of Hearing, dated August 4. 2016; Exhibit4: Respondent's 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, and supporting documents, including Tabs A — D, filed September 20. 2016 Exhibit 5: Notice of Hearing, dated September 20, 2016; Exhibit 6: Notice of Hearing, dated September 6, 2017: Exhibit 7A: Respondent's Motion for Continuance, filed February 16, 2018: Exhibit 7B: Order Granting Continuance. dated March 9, 2018; 2o0f 16 Exhibit 8: Respondent's Brief and supporting documents, including Tabs A ~ X, filed November 13, 2018: Exhibit 9: Respondent's additional supporting documents, including Respondent's Updated Sworn Statement, Tab A. filed November 21, 2018; Exhibit 10: Respondent's Credible Fear Worksheet and Interview, dated May 11, 2016: Exhibit 11: Respondent's Order of Protection from the First Peace Court, dated August 18, 2009; Exhibit 12: Abstract: Dominique J.-F. de Quervain, et al., “Glucocorticoids and the regulation of memory in health and disease,” Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology, Volume 30, Issue 3, August 2009. The Court has considered all of these documents in their entirety, regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision. The representative for the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) objected to the admission of Exhibit 8, Tabs C~F and H — J. ‘The Court admitted Tab F, a mental health evaluation of the Lead Respondent, over the objection of DHS. The Court reasoned that the document corroborated the Lead Respondent's claims of harm in El Salvador. However. insofar as the document contains legal conclusions, those conclusion will be not considered. ‘Tabs H ~J contain redacted decisions from Immigration Courts in other jurisdictions and be admitted as non-binding, persuasive authorities. The Court notes that these decisions predate the Attomey General's decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dee. 316 (A.G. 2018), and the Court will weigh their persuasive value accordingly. n country conditions reports from experts in gender-motivated violence El Salvador, and Tab E contains a report from a psychiatrist concerning the effect of trauma on a person's ability to recall specific facts. After the individual hearing on November 27, 2018, the Respondents filed supplemental supporting documents for Tabs C — E, containing CVs and publications of the authors of each of the reports. The Respondents have sufficiently demonstrated each author's expertise in their respective fields of study, and accordingly the Court will admit their opinions into evidence as the opinions of consulting, non-testifying experts. Il, Summary of Testimonial Evidence On November 27, 2018, the Court heard testimony the Lead Respondent (“the Respondent”). Although the Court has considered the testimony in its entirety, the testimony is not fully repeated herein, as it is part of the record. Instead, the claims raised during testimony are presented below to the extent that they are relevant to the Court's analysis. The Respondent testified that she was born in San Salvador, El Salvador. The Respondent recalled that her childhood was very sad. and she felt very alone. She met Carlos 3 of 16 Carlos”) while he was playing soccer. They began dating when she was 15 or 16, and the couple moved in together when the Respondent was 16, At the beginning of their relationship, Carlos was kind to the Respondent and treated her the way a partner should, After the Respondent became pregnant with their first child, Carlos began assaulting her. He would verbally abuse her by calling her “useless,” “lazy-ass,” “good-for-nothing,” and “stupid.” He would verbally abuse her for various reasons, including if she did not have his food ready when he came home. Carlos then began sexually abusing the Respondent. The Respondent recalled one day when Carlos came home drunk and demanded that she have sex with him. Carlos told her he wanted to have anal sex. The Respondent told him no, that she did not want to. Carlos told her she was his property and that she had to obey him and do whatever he wanted. He became very angry when she refused him, they struggled, and Carlos stripped her and took her outside naked. He locked her outside for approximately 30 minutes. She was humiliated and ashamed that het neighbors could see her naked. Carlos then raped her. Carlos would force the Respondent to have sex with him five or more times per week. The Respondent decided that she wanted to leave Carlos around this time. One night, when Carlos again came home drunk, the Respondent decided to confront him and tell him she was going to leave. They started to argue, and Carlos became furious, started to insult her, and kicked her in the leg. ‘The Respondent left the house when her son was about seven years old, and went to stay with her father in San Salvador, about a three hour drive from where she lived with Carlos. About a month and a half after she left, Carlos convinced her to come back to theit house. He told her he would change and that he would not treat her the same way anymore. The Respondent said that this was not true: Carlos became more angry and violent because she had left him, On one occasion, Carlos came home around four in the afternoon, and the Respondent was washing clothes. He became angry and asked why she was washing clothes at that time of day. as clothes should be washed in the morning. He told her she was supposed to obey him and do what he told her to do. He continued to yell and insult her, and then began beating her. Carlos punched the Respondent, breaking her nose and leaving bruises all over her body. ‘The Respondent began having nightmares as a result of this abuse. She would wake up the middle of the night feeling like she was suffocating. This happened frequently during this time. The Respondent described Carlos’ character as machista. According to the Respondent. ‘machismo is the belief that a man can impose his will on a woman, who has to obey everything he says. This view is very prevalent in E] Salvador. Men look down on women and feel superior. The Respondent disagrees with the machismo belief. She believes women are equal to men and have the same rights as men. The Respondent would express this view to Carlos, that women deserved equal treatment to men and have the same rights as men, He would become furious and declare that she was his property and that she would always be “his.” He would often become 4 of 16 physically abusive when the Respondent would express her views that men and women are equal. ‘The Respondent left Carlos again when her daughter Genesis was about a year and a half old. She attempted to come to the United States, but she was apprehended in Mexico and deported from that country. The Respondent then went to her father’s house, The Respondent never told her father about the abuses she suffered from Carlos. Carlos had threatened her and told her not to tell anyone. She was very afraid of Carlos at this time. When she told him that she intended to come to the United States, he beat her. Carlos found her at her father’s house and raped her. He was angry and told the Respondent that she had to come back with him. The Respondent obeyed and returned to their house. When she returned with Carlos. the verbal. physical. and sexual abuse continued. The Respondent decided she wanted him out of her house, so she went to court to get an order against him. The court ordered him out of the house, but Carlos was able to ignore the court order and remain in the house. The Respondent decided to put Carlos’ things outside of the house and lock hhim out. Carlos began to harass her: he would follow her. would stay around the house, and try to get in whenever he could. At some point, the Respondent called the police to report Carlos’ harassment and trespassing. The police would often take one or two hours to arrive, and they would not investigate what was happening. On one occasion, the Respondent's daughter was sick. so she took her two youngest children to the doctor. When they returned, the Respondent was carrying her sick daughter and tried to open the door to their house. Carlos was able to force his way into the house, and he told their daughters to stay by the door. He pushed the Respondent into the bedroom, and she knew he was going to rape her. She began to scream for help. and a neighbor, hearing her screams, ‘came over. Carlos threatened the neighbor, saying she should not get involved in things that were not her business. He also said bad things would happen to her too. The neighbor left the house. Carlos and the Respondent struggled. The Respondent tried to fight back and scream, but Carlos put a pillow over her face. Carlos then raped her. The Respondent called the police, but they said they could not do anything because they did not know who he was. The Respondent's neighbor told her that she did not want to be involved if the Respondent called the police. The Respondent provided the police with a picturé of Carlos, but because they were not able to arrest him within 72 hours, nothing came of the investigation. On one occasion, Carlos managed to sneak into the house when the Respondent was trying to leave. She tried to grab a phone so that she could call the police, but Carlos threatened her with a 12-inch knife that he found lying on the table. He made her give him the phone and threatened her by making gestures as if he would stab her in the chest. On another occasion, Carlos stole a gas tank from the Respondent's house, which the Respondent used for cooking. The Respondent called the police, and they said they would Sof 16 retrieve the gas tank if she found out where it was. The Respondent found out where Carlos had the gas tank, called the police, and the police managed to get the gas tank back. Carlos was not arrested for this theft. Carlos raped the Respondent again. She filed a criminal complaint. At this point, the Respondent had called the police over 10 times to report Carlos’ various crimes. The Respondent had to tell the police where to find Carlos in order for them to arrest him. Carlos was arrested and charged with rape. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, although he only served three of those years. After his release from prison, Carlos did not leave the Respondent alone. He would continue to follow her and spy on her. On one occasion, Carlos’ mother had asked the Respondent if she could take her grandchildren and give them a chance to see their father. Carlos’ mother told the Respondent that she would pick up the kids and drop them off later. Instead, Carlos brought the kids back to the house. He went through the house and made gestures like he was going to kill her. Carlos would also come to the Respondent's work and act like he was trying to court her. When she ignored him, he would become angry. He would accuse her of being with another man and call her a prostitute. On the street. Carlos would come up to the Respondent and threaten to kill her. One time, the Respondent was with her son, and Carlos threatened to kill them both, stuff them in black bags, and dump their bodies in a place called £1 Coco. The Respondent knew of a mother and daughter who were killed in £/ Coco. The Respondent stated that the man who Killed the two women was machisia, and he killed them because the daughter, with whom the man had a romantic relationship, slapped him for beating her in front of her mother. The man shot the mother and daughter several times, and the daughter was pregnant at the time. £1 Caco had a reputation in the community for violent crime, especially gang violence. The Respondent went to court again to seek protection from Carlos, The court asked Carlos if he would like to serve the remainder of his prison sentence and told him this would happen if he kept bothering the Respondent. The Respondent characterized this as an empty threat. This warming from the court did not work. as Carlos threatened her again in person about 30 minutes after the court hearing. Afier that, the Respondent did not go back to the courts for protection. She did not believe they would protect her. but rather “it would be like every other time.” ‘The Respondent decided to leave El Salvador again for the United States, She knew she could not relocate within El Salvador because Carlos would find her, just as he did twice before. Since the Respondent left El Salvador, Carlos has approached their son several times. Carlos has told their son that he wants to kill the Respondent and that he still considers the Respondent his property. Carlos is now seeing another woman in El Salvador. ‘The Respondent stated that, if she returned to El Salvador, Carlos would likely follow through on his threats to kill her. She is also afraid he would again physically abuse her or rape her if she returned. The Respondent feared for her daughters in El Salvador as well, although she did not believe that Carlos would seriously harm them or kill them. 6 0f 16 ANALYSIS, FINDINGS, AND CONCLUSIONS, I. Asylum pursuant to INA § 208 Generally, for the Court to consider an asylum application, the respondent must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she or he filed an 1-589, Application for Asylum, within one year of their arrival in the United States. INA § 208(a)(2)(B). Respondent bears the burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i). A respondent's testimony alone may meet their burden of proof if it is credible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii); Matter of J-Y-C-. 24 [&N Dee. 260, 263 (BIA 2007). In determining credibility, the Court must consider “the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors.” INA § 240(c)(4)(C). Nevertheless, the Court may find that corroborating evidence is necessary for a respondent to meet their burden of proof. INA § 208(b\\(1(B\\ii). When the Court determines corroborating evidence is necessary, “such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.” Id, To be statutorily eligible for asylum, a respondent must show that she or he is a refugee as defined by INA § 101(@)(42\\(A). INA § 208(b)(1)(A). A refugee is a person, outside their country of nationality, who is unable or unwilling to return to or to avail himself o herself of the protection of that country because of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(a)(42)(A). Finally, the Court may grant asylum in the exercise of diseretion if'an applicant demonstrates statutory eligibility. INA § 208(b) 1A) Respondents entered United States on Ap 30, 2016): Exhibit 4 (demonstrating asylum application filed September 20, 2016). Further. after tecall many dates nor present events in perfect chronological order, the Respondent has demonstrated that her inability to recall specific dates and the order of events could likely be attributed to her PTSD diagnosis. Exhibit 8, Tabs E-F; See also Exhibit 12. Further, her testimony in court was generally consistent with her written statement, see Exhibit 9, Tab A, and that statement will be used to supplement her testimony in the Court’s analysis. The Respondent has also provided sufficient corroborating evidence. See Exhibits 4, 8-12 ‘The remaining issues present in this case are whether the Respondent has established: (1) past persecution (2) on account of a protected ground, (3) which the government of El Salvador is unable or unwilling to protect her from, and (4) despite changes in country conditions, she has a well-founded fear of persecution in El Salvador. For the reasons discussed in detail below, the Court finds the Respondent has demonstrated statutory eligibility for asylum and will grant asylum in the exercise of discretion. 7 0f 16 A. Persecution ‘An applicant for asylum must demonstrate either that he or she has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of nationality or last habitual residence. INA §§ 101(a¥42)(A): 208(b)(1)(A). There is no universally accepted definition of “persecution.” See Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 51 (Geneva, January 1992) (“UNHCR Handbook”), Nevertheless. persecution has generally been interpreted to involve “a threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who differ in a way regarded as offensive.” Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). Persecution within the meaning of the Act is harm of a degree surpassing “mere harassment[.J” Liv. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171. 177 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Dandan v. Asheroft, 339 F.3d 567, 373 (7th Cir. 2003): see also Acosta, 19 [&N Dec. at 222. In determining whether mistreatment constitutes persecution, the Fourth Circuit has observed that persecution is systematic, whereas less-severe mistreatment is generally limited to isolated incidents. Baharon v. Holder, 588 F.3d 232 (4th Cir. 2009), The Fourth Circuit has expressly held ““the threat of death qualities as persecution.’” Hemandez-Avalos v. Lynch. 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Crespin- ‘Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126). Jere, the Respondent <a RR RRA Carlos. Carlos (@PRAibe Respondent many times, from about 2001 until 2009.

The Respondent characterized Carlos” treatment, and the Court agrees that his conducted can only be described, as dehumanizing. See id. Here. there can be little doubt that the harm the Respondent suffered in El Salvador from Carlos rose to the level of persecution. B. On Account of a Protected Ground — ‘An applicant for asylum must establish that the persecution he or she suffered occurred “on account of” one of the five protected grounds ~ race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(a)(42)(A). This requires a two-fold showing: first, that the applicant has an actual or imputed characteristic falling within one of the 8 of 16 five protected grounds; and second. that the persecution the applicant suffered or fears was on account of such a characteristic. See Saldarriaga v. Gonzales. 402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir. 2005); see also INS v, Elias-Zacarias, $02 U.S. 478, 482-83 (1992) First, (QUSEDI ADI MONA BEUORPONCANOPIAIOM the applicant must demonstrate that he or she holds a political opinion as contemplated by the Act. In order to do so, he or she must generally show some expressive behavior in support of a particular cause. Saldarriaga, 402 F.3d at 466. Eligibility for asylum based upon an applicant's political opinion presupposes that the applicant holds opinions critical of and not tolerated by the persecutor, and such opinions have come to the attention of the persecutor or are attributed by the persecutor to the applicant. See UNHCR Handbook, § 80 (discussing political opinion in context of government-sponsored persecution). For an opinion to be deemed political. the actions taken in furtherance of that opinion must be “motivated by an ideal or conviction” and not motivated by personal benefit, including fear of retribution or an employment benefit. Saldarriaga, 402 F.3d at 466. Here, the Respondent stated that @RGIISAGESENMD the machismo belief and culture, which perpetuates the idea that men are superior to women and are therefore justified in controlling and imposing their will on women. She stated that $§8)5BHEWes men and women are equal and enjoy equal rights. The Court finds that th@JBeli@Bthat women are the equal of men is a political opinion as contemplated by the Act. See Matter of R-A-. 22 1&N Dec. 906, 940 (BIA 1999) (Board Member Guendelsberger, dissenting) (“Opposition to male domination and violence against women, and support for gender equality. constitutes a political opinion.”); see also Fatin 12 F.3d 1233, 1242 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[W]e have little doubt that feminism qualifies as a political opinion the meaning of the relevant statutes.”) Accordingly, the remaining issue is whether the Respondent was persecuted on account of her political opinion. To demonstrate the nexus requirement, an applicant must show through direct or circumstantial evidence that a protected ground was “at least one central reason” for the persecution. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); see also Matter of C-T-L-, 25 1&N Dec. 341, 344 (BIA 2010): Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 1&N Dec. 208. 214 (BIA 2007). The applicant need not prove that the protected ground was the central reason or even a dominant central reason for the persecution; he or she “need only show that the protected ground was more than an incidental, tangential, superficial. or subordinate reason underlying the persecution.” Zavaleta-Policiano Sessions, 873 F.3d 241, 247 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Quinteros-Mendoza v, Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009)) (internal quotations omitted). Persecution on account of the statutorily protected grounds refers to persecution motivated by the vietim’s traits, not the persecutor’s, Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 482. ‘The Court finds the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) decision in Matter of R. J&N Dec. 906 (BIA 1999; A.G. 2001)!. particularly instructive. In that case, the respondent alleged facts strikingly similar to the Respondent in this case. The respondent in R-A- was \"" remanded for reconsideration in Matter ot 24 1. & N. Dec. 629 (A.G. 2008). The Court notes that the procedural history of this ease after the 1999 BIA decision, although lengthy. dealt primarily withthe BIA’s analysis of the alleged particular social group in the case. As such, this Court understands that the BIA’s discussion of Political opinion has been left undisturbed by the subsequent procedural history and remains instructive, 9 of 16 physically, verbally, and sexually abused by her husband in Guatemala over the course of many years, and she feared he would kill her if she returned to the country, 22 I&N Dec. at 908-09. Her husband would often tell her that she was his property, that she had to obey him, and that he could do anything to her that he liked. Id. The respondent disagreed with these statements and would often resist his abuses. Id. The BIA ultimately found that the respondent had not demonstrated that the abuse she suffered was on account of her political beliefs. Id. at 914-17. Although the Board did not articulate a test for determining whether the respondent's political opinion was one central reason for her husband’s abuse, the Board did consider the following factors in its analysis: (1) whether the abuse began when the respondent expressed a political opinion; (2) whether and to what extent the specific instances of abuse appeared to be in response to the respondent's objections or acts of resistance: (3) whether the abuses were more fairly attributed to the abuser’s views of woman, rather than the respondent's: (4) whether the respondent, during the abuse or in her testimony, ever expressed an opinion, apart from the common human desire to avoid physical harm; (5) whether the abuser ever targeted other women for such treatment, who would presumably share the respondent's beliefs; and (6) whether the respondent could have avoided harm by harboring a different political opinion, Id. at 914-25. In R-A-, the Board concluded that the respondent's persecutor harmed her regardless of her political beliefS, and his behavior was wholly independent of her belief’. Id. at 914-15. The facts of this case. although facially similar to the facts alleged in R-A-, are distinguishable from in crucial respects. First, unlike the respondent in R- here, the Respondent's abuse escalated when she resisted her partner's advances, and his abuses became more violent in response to her objections and acts of resistance. Although the Respondent testified that Carlos began abusing her verbally early in their relationship, the sexual abuse only began afier the Respondent expressed her opinion that she was not his property and did not have to obey him. See Exhibit 9, Tab A. Sometime in 2001. Carlos insisted that the Respondent have anal sex with him, Id. When she refused, Carlos told the Respondent that she was his property and he could do whatever he wanted. Id. The Respondent countered that she was not his property and continued to refuse him. Id. This was the first time Carlos raped the Respondent. See id. The physical abuse also only began after this exchange between Carlos and the Respondent over whether she belonged to him and had to do whatever he asked. See id. The Respondent also testified that Carlos’ abuses would become more violent in response to her resistance to his authority and her expression of the belief that men and women are equal. For instance, after the Respondent left Carlos the first time. he became more violent to “punish [her] for leaving him.” Id. Whenever the Respondent would tell Carlos that she was not his property, he would hit her and yell at her that she would always be his. Id. The second time the Respondent tried to leave Carlos, Carlos found her and raped her in her father’s house. Id. The Respondent stated that she sought help from the courts because she did not want her children to think it was acceptable for a man to treat a woman the way"
,"Carlos treated her. Id. After the Respondent received a restraining order against Carlos, he continued to harass her, threaten her, and rape her. Id. The Respondent's acts of resistance — including refusing to have sex with Carlos whenever and in whatever manner he demanded, leaving him repeatedly. getting a restraining order against him, calling the police on him, and moving his things out of their house — can be properly interpreted as political expressions, in light of her statements to him that she was not his property and her statements to Carlos and this Cour that she believes woman are equal to men. 10 of 16 Second, while Carlos’ view of women undoubtedly contributed to his abuses, this does not preclude a finding that the Respondent's beliefs were nevertheless one central reason for the abuse. The Respondent stated that Carlos was machista and believed that women were inferior to men and had to obey them. See Exhibit 9, Tab A. Although Carlos’ view of women contributed to his abuse of the Respondent, it was her resistance to this belief that often instigated and escalated his abuses. Some of Carlos’ abuse, primarily the verbal abuse, began early in the relationship, before the Respondent actively resisted his abuse or expressed her view of women, However. the first instance of rape occurred in direct response to the Respondent's assertion of her right to her body. Read in that context, Carlos’ actions appear to be taken in order to punish the Respondent for her belief, to prove to her that only he controlled her body. Carlos did not just want to have sex with the Respondent against her will, he wanted to humiliate her, subjugate her, and show her that she was wrong: he could do whatever he wanted with her body. See Angoucheva v. INS. 106 F.3d 781, 793 n.2 (7th Cir. 1997) (Rovner, J.. concurring) (stating that “[rlape and sexual assault are generally understood today not as sexual acts borne of attraction, but as acts of violent aggression that stem irom the perpetrator's power over and desire to harm his vietim{.|\""). Further, the abuses Carlos inflicted on the Respondent in direct response to her assertion that women are equal to men and that she was not his property can be fairly attributed. not only to Carlos’ belief in the opposite, but also to his desire to overcome her belief. punish her for holding it, and prove her that she was wrong. See Matter of L-E-A-, 27 [&N Dec. 40, 44 n.2 (BIA 2017) (citing Acosta, 19 I&N Dee. at Persecution’ ... clearly contemplates that harm or suffering must be inflicted upon an individual in order to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome.”)) (citing Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 365 (BIA 1996) (clarifying punitive intent not required, rather persecutor must intend to “overcome” protected characteristic of vietim)). Third, in direct contrast to the respondent in R-A-, and as discussed above in some detail. the Respondent actually expressed her belief that women are equal to men, both to Carlos during his acts of violence and in her testimony before this Court, Fourth, the Respondent and her son have stated that Carlos now has another girlfriend, whom he also abuses. See Exhibit 9, Tab A; Exhibit 8, Tab B. Apparently, this woman also tried to called the police to report Carlos” abuse, which suggests to the Court that she does not share his machismo beliefs. See Exhibit 8, Tab B. This suggests that Carlos’ abuse of this woman may also be perpetrated in order to overcome her belief and demonstrate his superiority over her Finally, there is evidence in the record that the Respondent could have avoided persecution by holding and expressing a different political opinion. If the Respondent adopted Carlos’ belief that women are inferior to men and have to obey them, or even if she were completely ambivalent to such an idea, she would have likely avoided much of the harm she suffered. As issed above, Carlos’ sexual abuse and physical abuse of the Respondent only oceurred after she challenged his authority over her body and expressed her view that she was not subservient to his will. See Exhibit 9, Tab A. In fact, the Respondent stated that she would occasionally be submissive to Carlos in order to avoid his abuses, and although this worked, she was left feeling “humiliated by this submission.” Id. 11 of 16 Applying the same factors relied upon by the Board in R-A-, the Court finds that the Respondent has demonstrated that the abuses she suffered from Carlos were perpetrated on account of her belief that women are equal to men. ‘As the Court has found the Respondent's political beliefs were one central reason for her persecution, the Court need not determine whether the Respondent's alleged particular social ‘groups were also central reasons for the abuse.* State Action To be eligible for asylum, the persecution suflfered by the applicant must have been perpetrated by the applicant's government, an agent the government, or by a private person or group whom the government is unwilling or unable to control. See Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d ‘at 128; Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222. An applicant seeking to establish persecution based upon the violent conduct of a private actor must show more than difficulty controlling private behavior, but rather “must show that the government condoned the private actions or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the vietims. 27 1&N Dec. 316, 337 (A.G. 2018) (internal quotations omitted): see also Matter of O-Z- & 22 I&N Dee, 23. 25-26 (BIA 1998) (reiterating standard is whether government is unable or unwilling to protect respondent, not merely whether the persecution was government-directed or condoned). Although different language has been used to describe this standard, the Court understands that the Respondent need only show either that the government is unable to protect her from Carlos (ie. cannot offer effective protection or is helpless to protect her) or is unwilling to protect her from the same (i.e. the government directed, condoned, or otherwise acquiesced to her persecution), See A-B-. 27 1&N Dec. at 337; O-Z> & I-Z-, 22 I&N Dee, at 26: Acosta, 19 18&N Dec, at 222. Here, the Court finds that the government of E1 Salvador was unable to control Carlos and protect the Respondent from his abuses. The state intervened in the Respondent's relationship with Carlos several times, but each intervention was grossly ineffective. ‘The Respondent gave the government of El Salvador every opportunity to protect her from Carlos, and the government was ultimately unable to provide adequate protection. The Respondent called the police over 10 times to report Carlos’ abuses and seek protection for her family, and she resorted to the courts to get and enforce a restraining order against him on at least two occasions. Exhibit 9, Tab A. In 2009, the Respondent was issued a protective order against Carlos. See id.; Exhibit 11. The court urged Carlos to refrain from future acts of violence and threatened that he would be prosecuted for domestic violence if he repeated his previous acts of violence. Exhibit 11. After this warning, Carlos entered the Respondent's home and raped her Exhibit 9, Tab A. When the Respondent reported the incident to the police, she provided a picture of Carlos to the police, but he was never arrested. Id. The police later helped the Respondent retrieve a gas tank that the Respondent has stolen, but only after she told them where to find the gas tank. Id. Carlos was not arrested on this occasion either. Id. Carlos walked through the protection order a second time to rape the Respondent. Id. Carlos was only arrested ind “Salvadoran women ‘The Respondent articulated the following two social groups: “Salvadoran women’ viewed as property by a former domestic partner with whom she shares common children.” 12 of 16 once, and only after the Respondent informed the police where they could find him. Id. Carlos was sentenced to eight years in prison for the rape. although, for reasons unknown to the Court, he only served three of those years. Id. Once he was released. he went back to harassing and abusing the Respondent. Id. The Respondent continued to go to the police for protection, but they failed to enforce the protective order or arrest the Respondent. Id. Only after Carlos threatened the Respondent and her son with death and dismemberment did the police get involved and bring Carlos to court. Id. The court warned Carlos that he would have to serve the remainder of his prison sentence if he continued to threaten and harm the Respondent. Id. Within an hour of leaving the courtroom, Carlos repeated his threat to kill the Respondent. Id. The Court finds that the government of E] Salvador was, at times, willing to protect the Respondent from Carlos, but on each occasion, the government failed to deliver adequate protection to prevent her further persecution by Carlos. In 1996, El Salvador enacted the Law Against Intrafamilial Violence (“LAIV\""), which provided the primary legal regime for prosecuting and combating domestic violence. Exhibit 8, Tab C. This was the same law under which Carlos was charged in 2009, when the court issued an order of protection over the Respondent. See Exhibit 11. In 2011 and 2012. two laws went into effect that targeted violence against women and discrimination based on gender. Exhibit 8, Tab C. However, even several years after the 2011 and 2012 laws went into effect, there has not been a decline in violence or discrimination against women nor a decline in impunity for perpetrators. Id. The non-test experts who provided statements in this case each expressed that this legal regime provided ineffective protections for victims of domestic violence. See Exhibit 8, Tabs C — D. One such expert posited that the pervasive cultural attitudes toward women lead “law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges [to] discriminate against women, reduce the priority of Women’s claims and otherwise prevent women from accessing legal protections and justice.” Exhibit 8, Tab C. The facts of this case demonstrate this reality in El Salvador. The Respondent sought help from the police many times. The police often arrived several hours after they received her call, allowing Carlos an opportunity to evade them every time. Exhibit 9, Tab A. The police arrested Carlos once, but only after the Respondent told them where they could find him ~ effectively doing their investigatory work for them. Id. The police also confiscated the Respondent's stolen gas tank from Carlos. but once again only after she informed them where it was, and they did not arrest Carlos for the theft or harassment. Id. The police demonstrated a total lack of concern for the Respondent's safety in their responses to her pleas for help. Similarly, after the Court had issued the Respondent an order of protection and Carlos had been incarcerated for raping the Respondent, the Respondent once again sought help from the courts. ‘See id. The court warned Carlos not to harm her and threatened to have him serve the remainder of his eight-year sentence. See id. It is unimaginable to this Court why ~ after the history of abuse perpetrated by Carlos against the Respondent, even after an order of protect was granted ~ the court in El Salvador would simply provide a warning to Carlos on this occasion. It is clear from the record that Carlos did not respect orders from the court, and the warnings from the court were, as the Respondent accurately stated, empty threats. ‘The Respondent has demonstrated that the government of El Salvador was completely helpless in protecting her against Carlos. Even when the law provided protections for the Respondent, the Respondent exercised her rights, and the court gave her an order of protection, law enforcement officials and the courts failed to enforce that order and the Respondent's rights 13 of 16 on numerous occasions. The only effective protection the government provided the Respondent ‘was in Carlos’ incarceration, and for reasons unknown to the Court, his sentence was never fully enforced. Under these circumstanees. it is clear the government of El Salvador was unable to control Carlos and prevent further harm to the Respondent. D. —_ Well-Founded Fear If an applicant for asylum demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he or she also has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 CFR § 1208.13(b)(1). DHS bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that either: (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of nationality on account of one of the enumerated grounds; or (2) the applicant ‘could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country of nationality and under the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect them to do so. 8 C.ER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i(A)-(B); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3)Gi) (where the government is the persecutor, or where past persecution is established. internal relocation is presumptively unreasonable). Here, as the Respondent has demonstrated past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that she also has a well-founded fear of persecution in El Salvador. Further, DHS has not met its burden of demonstrating that either changed country conditions or an internal relocation altemative exists so as to negate the Respondent's well-founded fear of persecution in EI Salvador. As the Court requested supplemental briefing on the issue of well-founded fear and DHS failed to file such a brief, the Court will limit its analysis to the arguments put forward by DHS during the Respondent's individual hearing. DHS never attempted to demonstrate that changed country conditions rendered the Respondent's fear of future persecution unreasonable. DHS attempted to show that an internal relocation alternative existed for the Respondent in El Salvador. The Court finds that such a relocation is unreasonable under the circumstances. First, the Court notes that the Respondent was not able to avoid Carlos’ abuse by relocating within the country. The Respondent went to live with her father twice, each time to a different location, to avoid Carlos’ abuse. See Exhibit 9, Tab A. On both occasions, Carlos was able to find her, despite the fact that the Respondent's father lived in San Salvador, about three hours away from Carlos by car. Id. Second, the Respondent alleged in her written statement that Carlos was affiliated with the 18th Street Gang in the country, which suggests that she would not be able to hide from him anywhere in El Salvador iff he truly wanted to find her. See id; see also Exhibit 8, Tab D (“If a woman is in a violent relationship with a gang member, her chance of escaping safely is Virtually nonexistent due to the ubiquitous networks gangs maintain throughout the country.”). Third, the opinion of an expert in domestic violence in El Salvador and the Respondent's experience suggest she would not be able to avoid Carlos by relocating within El Salvador. The expert in domestic violence in El Salvador found that several factors — including the small size of the country, the little respect given to women’s privacy, women’s financial constraints, and the cultural importance of family unity — contributed to the fact that it is very hard for a woman to extricate herself from an abusive relationship. Exhibit 8, Tab D. The expert stated that abusive men “will pressure relatives with information {of the victim's whereabouts] by explaining that he wants to reunite his family.” Id. (explaining this tactic is often sucessful with police, schools, and hospitals as well), Indeed. such was the case here. On one occasion, 14 of 16 Carlos was able to find the Respondent at her father’s home because he asked the Respondent's uncle where she was, and he gave Carlos the address. Based on these facts, the Court finds the Respondent cannot relocate to another part of El Salvador to avoid persecution by Carlos. However, even if the Court were to consider the presumption of well-founded fear rebutted, the Respondent would still warrant protection in the form of humanitarian asylum. Where the applicant has established past persecution but no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution, an Immigration Judge should consider an applicant’s eligibility for humanitarian asylum. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii); Matter of S-A-K- & H-A-H-, 24 I&N Dec. 464, 465-66 (BIA 2008). Humanitarian asylum may be granted if the applicant either (1) demonstrates that he or she has “compelling reasons.” arising out of the severity of the past persecution, for being unable or unwilling to return to his or her country: or (2) establishes that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer “other serious harm” upon removal to that country, 8 C.F-R. § 1208.13(b)(I)Gi)(A)-(B): Matter of L-S-. 25 [&N Dec. 705, 710-15 (BIA 2012). In determining eligibility for humanitarian asylum, the Court must consider the “totality of the circumstances” on a case-by-case basis. Id. at 715. Humanitarian asylum based on “compelling reasons” is warranted if the applicant demonstrates that in the past he or she or his or het family “suffered under atrocious forms of persecution.” Matter of N-M-A-, 22 1&N Dec. 12, 325 (BIA 1998) (considering the degree of harm suffered, the length of time over which the harm was inflicted, and evidence of severe psychological trauma stemming from the harm); see also Matter of Chen, 20 1&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1989) (granting humanitarian asylum to an applicant who suffered severe persecution in the past, leaving him physically debilitated, anxious and fearful, and often suicidal). Here, the Respondent has demonstrated that she has compelling reasons for being unwilling to retum to El Salvador. The Respondent testified that she suffered from recurring nightmares in El Salvador as a result of the abuses she suffered from Carlos. According to her psychological evaluation, the Respondent exhibited severe levels of anxiety and met the full criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). Exhibit 8, Tab F. Indeed. this Court witnessed some of the lingering effects of her severe trauma in her inability to recall dates or the chronology of events during her testimony. See Exhibit 8, Tab E, Exhibit 12. The Court finds that the Respondent endured heinous abuses over an extended period of time, which have caused lasting trauma, The Court believes that the Respondent's current anxiety and PTSD would only be worsened if she were returned to El Salvador. The Respondent expressed to her counselor that she feels constantly “on-guard,” always fearful that Carlos will be able to find her, even in the United States. Exhibit 8. Tab E. Based on the Respondent's experience in the past and her reasonable belief that Carlos would be able to find her anywhere in the country, it is clear that the Respondent would not be able to cope with or successfully treat her anxiety or PTSD if she returned to El Salvador. The Court finds that the heinous abuses suffered by the Respondent the past coupled with her current mental health concems are sufficiently compelling reasons for her to be unwilling to return to El Salvador and for this Court to grant humanitarian asy: ‘lum. E. Discretion Once an applicant demonstrates his or her statutory eligibility for asylum, the applicant then has the burden of establishing that asylum is merited in the exercise of discretion. Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467, 474 (BIA 1987). In exercising discretion, the Court must examine the 15 of 16 totality of the circumstances. Id. at 473. The danger of persecution will outweigh all but the most egregious adverse factors. Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. at 367. Here, the Court finds there are no adverse factors weighing against a grant of asylum in this case. After considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Court will grant the Respondents’ application for asylum in the exercise of discretion, Il. Withholding of Removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) and under the CAT Here, as the Court has granted the Respondents discretionary relief in the form of asylum, the Court need not consider whether the Respondent warrants the mandatory relief in the form of withholding of removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) or protection under the CAT. Accordingly, the Court issues the following: Il. ORDERS ITS ORDERED tt te Responders Apltion fr Alam print INA § 208 is IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent's Application for Withholding of Removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) is NOT REACHED.

INTRODUCTION Respondenteiemagstemtonsing merits a grant of asylum as she has suffered past persecution in the form of harassment, death threats and attempted assassination by the ermtiiccmmpmpettionmmenemey. Furthermore, evidence submitted herewith demonstrates that ggg will suffer future physical harm and most likely death at the hands ofdemuihisiaw® if returned to Honduras. dsumiaiaaimgp’ unrelenting torment against Kessy, was on account oR@N9 membership in either of the following particular social 4 ‘groups “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” or “Hondurans taking concrete steps to oppose damm gang members and gang authority.” ‘Alternatively, the court may conclude that Kessy was persecuted based on her imputed anti-gang political opinion. In addition, Respondent, Mamaqutemtiaaiiogg, also qualifies for asylum due to the well-founded fear of future persecution of possible physical harm or death based upon an ongoing interfamily feud. Her uncle's family is systematically attempting to eliminate all of the family members of Hmpiegt® ConenbiaieeOOP This well- founded fear of persecution is on account ofeiémasggs membership in the particular social group “family members of (amaniamasaiansiiiaaSOoOe®.” Derivative Respondentsoaias@waisfalso independently qualifies for asylum or withholding of removal due to the realistic fear of future persecution from Los Chirizos on account of his membership in the particular social group “family members of =e Los Chirizos Summary: ‘After moving to Tegucigalpa and opening a small mini mart in 2014qidamgy began being targeted by the Los Chirizos gang for “war tax.” AC first, may resisted paying the ‘gang by ignoring their calls and changing her number, telling “collectors” that they had the wrong address and making excuses for not paying. After receiving death threats, éexepsuccumbed to the gang's will and started paying. Eventually, the payments proved to be too much for the business to handle and Simm could no longer pay. When she started falling behind on her payments Los Chirizos began stalking her and threatening to Kill her. She was told that if she did not pay the gang what was owed, then she would be burned alive with her young son. ‘After a nearby business owner and his family were bumed alive by the gang, and Los Chirizos gang members showed up at dims home in the middle of the night threatening to kill her; €#@8@Phad no other choice but to abandon her market and flee to the United States. Despite abandoning her market, the gang sought revenge for Smalls defiance and began looking for her. More than a year after her arrival in the United States, Los Chirizos murdered NRgMs sister-in-law nearly 40 miles away from where emma business was located. The sister-in-law was murdered because the gang mistakenly believed that the sister-in-law wassiumg in hiding. In Honduras, entire communities are dominated by one particular gang and subject to the gang's control. Gangs rule their territory as the surrogate government. As para state actors/local government, gang's levy taxes on individuals in the territory, control entry and exits to certain neighborhoods and “police” the locality. Gangs do this with almost complete impunity and non-action by the state. In some cases. this is done even with police acknowledgment and assistance. To dare to defy the gang through refusal to comply with specific demands, is rare and sharply noted. both by Honduran society and by the Gang’s themselves. Los Chirizos follows this modus operandi. As the “largest homemade gang” in Honduras. Los Chirizos maintains control over the inhabitants of the territories they dominate by terrorizing the local population into submission. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR). Los Chirizos imposes a large range of rules over the population living within the territories they govern including the strict rule of silence, enforced curfews and payment of “war taxes’ from businesses They also control wo can enter and exit their territory through checkpoints. (Tab Y. Ps. 226. 228), They react aggressively to state aciors, killing police officers and their families who live in the zones under their control and are extremely violent against anyone who challenges their authority. (Jd.). ‘To not comply with any of the gang's demands is to defy the gang's control and their de fucto governing authority. Such defiance is seen as a “crime” by the gang which inust be responded to with swift violence. Persecution in this context transforms from the gang's original motivation to eam money, grow, reenuit and transforms into something at odds with the original motive—ie to punish by death for refusal to acquiesce 10 the gang's demands. In the case of Samm. the Los Chirizos’ motive in persecuting @By i no longer the desire to earn money from her but rather (o kill her for defiance and the challenging of their authority. mily Foud Summary ‘The record reflects that multiple family members of iy have been murdered by her great uncle's family and the persecutors will not stop until she and her whole family are dead.

LEGAL STANDARDS A. — Standard for a Grant of Asylum § 1101(a)(42) ‘An asylum applicant bears the burden of proof and persuasion of showing that he or she is a refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that he or she is eligible for asylum under Section 208(a) of the act. 8 U.S.C. § 101(a)(42)(A). The definition of a \""refugee\"" as defined in INA § 101(a)(42)(A) is: “[A}ny person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is, unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well- founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, 12 nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.” ‘Therefore, to qualify for a grant of asylum, an applicant must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. (See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42), Matter of E-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 860, 860 (BIA 1997). The asylum applicant bears the burden of providing evidence, either direct or circumstantial, from which it is reasonable to conclude that her persecutor harmed her at least in part because of a protected ground. INS v, Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 482 (1992). Additionally, the test for refugee status includes both a subjective component and an objective component: the subjective componeat is satisfied ifthe fear is well-founded the objective component requires a showing by credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record that persecution is a reasonable possibility. Demirovski v. LN.S.,39 F.3d 177 (7th Cir. 1994); Kotasz v. ILN.S.,31 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 1994). This standard is met if a reasonable person in the applicant's situation would fear persecution. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 «g87). B. Standard for a Grant of Withholding of Removal ‘An applicant seeking withholding of removal is eligible if he can demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership ina particular social group, or political opinion. INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 413 (1984). Relief under withholding of removal is not discretionary, and if an alien meets the statutory criteria under 8 C.F.R. §1208.16(b) the Attorney General must withhold removal. INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415 (1999). Additionally, a request for withholding of removal is country specific, and is not subject to the one-year filing 1B deadline upon arrival like applications for asylum. Al-Bareh v. Chertoff, $52 F-Supp.24 794 (N.D. Ill. 2008). C. Eligibility for Convention Against Torture Relief In order to show prima facie eligibility for Torture Convention relief, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2). The pain or suffering must be inflicted by or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or person acting in an official capacity ancl while the person is in the offender's custody or physical control. 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1} and (6). Unlike asylum and withholding of removal under the Act, an applicant for Torture Convention relief need not prove a nexus to a statutory protected ground. An applicant need only show he would be subjected to torture with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or person acting in an official capacity in order to qualify for relief. 1. ARGUMENT ‘The testimony and evidence submitted in this case establishes that igmis eligible for relief via asylum; withholding of removal and the convention against torture. Each ground for relief is considered in greater detail as follows. A. Asylum i, 4M is Eligible for Asylum due to a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution from Los Chirizos, on account of her membership in the particular social group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” Qe is eligible for and should be granted asylum due to her past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution perpetrated by Los Chirizos on account of her membership in a particular social group “Honduran business owners who have refused to 14 pay war tax.” The Honduran government is unable or unwilling to proteci@SN00N from Los Chirizos. The absence of any changed circumstances to rebut a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, coupled withiiap's inability to relocate within Honduras makes her eligible for a grant of Asylum. 1, @MgMBSuffered Past Persecution ‘The Board of Immigration Appeals (hereafter “BIA”) has defined “persecution” for the purposes of the Act as a “threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who differ in a way that is regarded as offensive.” Matter of Acosta, 19 I8N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). In this case, SMB was subject to persistent extortion, stalking, harassment and threats of death from Los Chirizos. Los Chitizos also threatened to Kill@@amgp’s son by buming them both alive. The gang showed up at her house in the middle of the night and threatened to kill her. The gang has shown their perplexity to commit violence by burning to death a nearby business owner and the owner's family as well as mistakenly killing (@liaagss sister-in-law believing she waseilamlmp As a result of her persecution, iy continues to have deep emotional scars. According (ASIN LCSW aléamay still exhibits signs and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the gang's persecution. (Tab V, Pgs. 95-106). ‘The 7th Circuit has found that threats of grave harm or imminent death can tise to the level of persecution, even standing alone. WV. L. A. v Holder, 744 F. 3d 425, 431 (7th Cir, 2004)(citing Stanojkova v, Holder, 645 F.3d 943, 948 (7th Cir-2011); Bathula v. Holder, 723 F.3d 889, 900 (7th Cir. 2013); Boykov v. INS, 109 F.3d 413, 416 (7th Cir. 1997). Courts of Appeals decisions from other jurisdictions have also found that 15 economic extortion can constitute persecution when accompanied by threats of violence or severe harm. See; e.g. Ayala v. Sessions,855 F.3d 1012, 1021 (9th Cir. 2017). In determining whether the actions taken against an individual constitute persecution, the courts should evaluate them “cumulatively,” and determine whether the combination of those actions rises to the level of persecution. See; Ahmed v. Keisler, 504 F.3d 1194 (9\"" Cir. 2007); Khol-yavskiy v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 555, 570-571 (7 Cir. 2008). Here, both individually and cumulatively, the extortion, persistent harassment and ‘numerous death threats amount to the level of persecution necessary under INA § 101(8(42)(A). 2. Kessy Possesses a Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution (Semap demonstrated past persecution on account of a protected ground. As such, she is entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. See 8 CER. §1208,13(0)(1). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Honduras whereindly no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution or where aly could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of Honduras. /d. at §1208.13(b)(1)(ii). The record contains credible, direct, and specific evidence that future persecution is a reasonable possibility. See; Perkovic v. I.N.S., 33 F.3d 615 (6th Cir. 1994); Demirovski v. LN.S., 39 F.3d 177 (Mth Cir. 1994); Kotasz v. I.N.S., 31 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 1994). Specifically, the record demonstrates that Los Chirizos is an extremely large and dominant gang in Honduras and has been actively secking to fin MNP kill her. The 16 recent country conditions documentation provided bysAMMM§B demonstrates the enormous power that gangs like Los Chirizos hold in Honduras as well as their inclination and ability to track down those who defied them. (Tabs W, Z & QQ, Pgs. 130-131, 224-225, 327). Country conditions also demonstrate that large scale goverment corruption and ineffectiveness allow these gangs to operate with almost complete impunity. fd. DHS cannot prove any relevant change in circumstances. DHS also cannot establish that J can be reasonably expected to internally relocate given @JU® lack of resources and Los Chirizos ability to track her down with ease within the country. Based on all the foregoing, @amgP possesses a well-founded fear of future persecution and is eligible for and deserving of asylum relief. 3. SBm@p is a member of a cognizable Particular Social Group “Honduran ‘business owners who have refused to pay war tax” ‘The phrase “membership in a particular social group” is not defined under the Act. Therefore, the BIA has established a three-part test!' for evaluating whether a group meets the definition of a particular social group. First, the group must be comprised of individuals who share a common, immutable characteristic that members cannot change, or a characteristic so fundamental to the member's identity or conscience that he or she should not be required to change it. Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 233-34. Second, \""The Seventh Circuit does not find itself bound by the second and third requirements set forth by the BIA.! As such we do not believe that the Respondent must satisfy these conditions before this Court. However, we brief and argue these additional requirements in case this Court believes the op the BIA issued the decisions of M-E-V-G and W-G-R, the Seventh Circuit has published three deci that have discussed the particular social group definition. See; Sibanda v. Holder, 778 F.3d 616 (7* Cir. 2015); RA. v. Holder, 746 F.3d 807 (7 Cir. 2014) and NLA. v. Holder, 774 F.3d 425 (7 Cit. 2014. [None of these decisions have referenced M-E-V-G or W-G-R an all have reaffirmed the Acosta definition of particular social group as established in Cece. 7 the group must be defined by characteristics that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group. Matter of A-M-E- & J—U-, 24 I&N Dec. 69, 76 (BIA 2007); Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. 227, 239 (BIA 2014). Third, the group ‘must be recognizable and distinct in society. Id. at 240-241. ‘The analysis of whether a particular social group is cognizable demands a case-by case contextual analysis. Id, at 251. Accordingly, the BIA's holdings in Matter of S-E-G ‘and, 24 I&N Dec. 579 (BIA 2009) and Matter of E-A-G, 24 1 &N Dec. 591 (B.1.A. 2008) ‘are not meant to “be read as a blanket rejection of all factual scenarios involving gangs.” Matter of M-E-V-G, 26 I & N Dec. 227, 251 (BIA 2014). a, immutability Nationality has been found on several occasions by the U.S. Court of Appeals and the BIA to be an immutable characteristic that may define a social group. See, e.g., Cece v. Holder, 773 F.3d 662 (7\"" Cir. 2013): Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985). ‘Shared past experiences can also be an immutable characteristic. Benitez Ramos v. Holder, 589 F 34 426, 430-31 (7 Cir. 2009). Here members of the group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” are united by the innate characteristics of nationality and the shared past experience of having refused to pay extortion fees to gang members. b. Particularity With respect to particularity, the group must be defined by characteristics that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group. See; Matter of A- M-E & J-G-U-, 24 1&N Dec. at 76; Matter of M- G, 26 I&N Dec. at 239. Particularity requires proof that the social group is not amorphous and diffuse, but that it 18 is “sufficiently distinct” to be recognized “in the society in question, as a discrete class of persons.” Matter of S-E-G-, 24 1&N Dec. 579 (BIA 2008). ‘The particularity requirement asserted by the BIA in M-E-V-G and W-G-R is the ‘same definition that existed in 2009 when the Seventh Circuit held that “tattooed, former Salvador gang members” were a particular social group, Benitez-Ramos, 548 F.3d at 431 and in 2013, when the en banc Seventh Circuit found that “young Albanian women who lived alone” were a particular social group. Cece v. Holder, 733 F.3d 662 at 67. In this case, the group is sufficiently particular, as the term has been interpreted by the Seventh Circuit. It is not defined by unspecific or amorphous terms, any more than the groups accepted in Benitez Ramos, 589 F.3d 426 and Cece v. Holder, 733 F.3 662. It also is possible to determine whether or not an individual belongs to the social group with sufficient particularity, The social group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” has clear and precise boundaries. Only Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war taxes are members of this group. ‘Thus, there is a clear benchmark for determining who falls within this particular social group. C. Social Distinction To evaluate the issue of social distinction, the group must be “socially distinct within the society in question.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 237. To demonstrate social distinction, an applicant must provide evidence showing that society in general perceives, considers, or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group. Matter of W-G-R, 26 I&N Dec. 2017, 2015 (BIA 2014). The Board has described a range of evidence that can be considered when evaluating distinction, including high 19 rates of violence against group members, the enactment of laws designed to protect victims or punish perpetrators, and lack of effective enforcement of those laws. See; Matter of A-R-C-G, 26 1&N Dec. 388, 394 (BIA 2014). Distinction can also be shown by proof of differential or worse treatment of group members. See; ¢.g., M-E-V-G, 26 I& Dec. at 243. ‘The particular social group, “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay “war tax,” is socially distinct by the larger Honduran society. Country condition show that extortion by gangs against small businesses in the country of Honduras is an epidemic, “So extreme is extortion in Honduras that the Chamber of Commerce no longer publishes a registry of its members.” (Tab JJ, Pgs. 290-297). Not only does extortion have economic implications for the country, but it also leads to massive amounts of violence as people who don’t pay must die. (Labs Y, CC and IN). Central to gang mentality is the notion of respect and response to perceived acts of disrespect. Refusals to succumb to a gang's demands and/or any action that challenges the gang’s authority such as failing to pay “war tax” triggers a violent or punitive response. (Tab Y & Z, Pg. 210- 211, 228), To defy the gang by failing to pay war taxes is also sharply noted by Honduran society. (Tab JJ, Pg. 297). To combat its detrimental impact, Honduras has recently enacted laws to combat extortion. (See; Tab GG-HH, Pgs. 273-286). However, such laws and national anti- extortion policing efforts? have not made an effective impact in the overall violence ? To combat extortion and the accompanying violence, the Honduran government created a special National Anti-Extortion Task Force in 2013, comprising of vetted personnel from the Public Ministry, the National Police, the Armed Forces. and the National Office of Investigations and Intelligence. (ab FE, Pg. 272). However, these efforts have also done ‘and gangs extort with ‘almost complete immunity. 20 arising from gang extortion in Honduras and fail to provide sufficient protections against victims of extortion such as business owners. (See; Tab W, Y, BB, CC, Pgs. 131, 210. 249, 255), ‘The country conditions also objectively demonstrate that business owners are “preferred victims” of the gangs for extortion? and that extraordinarily high rates of violence are committed against those who have refused to pay “war tax” to gang members. According to Dr. Ubaldo Herrera Coello: “Gangs ... will kill residence who refuse to pay [taxes], seeking to make an example of those who resist. Those who refuse to pay have no option but to leave their homes, fearing for their lives.\"". (Tab W. Pg. 131) ‘The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Honduras, found: “The population of Honduras reportedly pays an estimated US$200 tillion per year in extortion money, which is often called a ‘war tax’ C‘impuesto de guerra’) by the gangs. Those who do not pay are reportedly ‘murdered or see their businesses burned down as a reprisal (Tab Z, Pa. 222). ‘The Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of intemally displaced persons on his Mission to Honduras, provides: “Extortion has reached epidemic proportions in many localities, in what is referred to by the gangs as a “war tax” imposed on small-business owners.... In some cases, multiple demands for payment come from different gangs. Marketplaces in Tegucigalpa have been affected, as store ‘owners have left to avoid the threats and extortion of the gangs. For many small businesses around the country, payment to the gangs has become the only way to continue to operate. Non-payment often results in death, as the gangs seek to make an example of any who defy them.” (Tab SS, Pg. 3 See; Tapiero De Orejuela v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 666, 675 (7th Cit. 2005) where the 7* Circuit found that “educated, landowning class of catlemen targeted by the FARC” to be a cognizable social grouping sharply noting in analysis thatthe class was not defined by wealth but rather that the “cttleman are among the guerrillas ‘prefered victims’.\"" 2 ‘The unilateral observations in governmental and humanitarian reports as well as ineffective laws to protect business owners from extortion show that “Honduran business ‘owners who have refused to pay war tax” are a socially distinct group within Honduran society. 4. ANexus Exists Between Sammy Persecution and a Qualifying Ground for Asylum ‘The statutory phrase “on account of” requires an applicant to demonstrate a nexus between the persecution and the protected ground asserted. See; Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84. While the protected ground does not have to be the sole reason the abuser persecuted the applicant, it must be “at least one central reason” for the persecution. Shakh v. Holder, 702 F.34 897, 902 (7 Cir. 2012). Rima is cligible for asylum because she possesses a nexus to one of the ‘enumerated grounds of persecution. Specifically, one central reason why @imgy suffered persecution from Los Chirizos was on account of her membership in the particular social ‘group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax.” ‘An integral part of why Los Chirizos targeted @immy hinges on the gangs need to eliminate those who defy the control over their territory. Remarks made by Los Chirizos {BEM curing the time of the abuse, and the attempted murder of QIN by the gang more than a year after her business closing, provides direct and circumstantial evidence of this nexus. Although the original motive of the gang may have been to make a profit, once imp openly defied the gang by not paying, the motive switched to one at odds with the original motive, in that now they had to kill @§MNB as a result of her defiance instead of making money from her. Tapiero De Orejuela v. Gonzales, 423 F. 3d 666 (7th Cir. 2005) is illustrative of this motive shifting ideology and instructive to the case at bar. In Tapiero De Orejuela, the Court reversed the immigration judges finding that the motive of the FARC to extort wealthy cattleranchers in Colombia was that of financial gain. In its finding the Court of Appeals found “while we are sure that FARC would be happy to take the opportunity to rob any Colombian (or foreigner for that matter) of his money, it is those who can be identified and targeted as the wealthy landowners that are at continued risk once they have been approached and refused to cooperate with FARC’s demands.” id at 677. Here similar to the FARC in Tapiero De Orejula, Los Chitizos originally identified and targeted l@gmy because she was a small business owner and her continued risk is due to her past refusal to cooperate with the gang. This is specifically confirmed when Q@gumpsister-in-law was mistakenly murdered with the belief the sister-in-law was MB, First, the shooter specifically confirmed the motive of the gang was not financial but rather punitive for defiance when he toldQ§0MNs husband “it's not about the money anymore.” Second, at the time of the murder the gang knew that@jgggpno longer had her business and would not be able to pay. In addition, they did not ask the sister-in-law for money before shooting her. The shooting was not a demand for money but rather an assassination, Country condition evidence also presents strong circumstantial evidence of Los Chirizos motive. As the report of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons on his mission to Honduras, explains “Extortion has reached epidemic proportions in many localities, in what is referred by the gangs as a “war tax” imposed on small-business owners... Non-payment often results in death, as the gangs seek to make an example of any who defy them.” (Tab SS, Pg. 339). 23 As the UNHCR Eligibility Guidclines for Assessing the International Protections Needs of Asylum-Seckers from Honduras, provides in its report specifically as to Los Chirizos: “The modus operandi of [Los Chirizos}... is reported to be similar to that of larger gang structures of Barrio 18 an MS... The Chirizas, in articular, are reportedly known for brutally torturing and killing those who defy them and leaving their bodies in public spaces.” (Tab ZZ, Pes. 226-228). Based on the evidence submitted, it is clear Los Chirizos continued persecution of @mmy is an account of her membership in the particular social group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” and not for economic reasons. 5. Altemative Social Group Formulations Alternatively, if the court were to conclude that “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” is not a cognizable social group, the Court can find that, (ame was persecuted based on account of her membership in the particular social group 3s\"" gang's authority.” + 6. Government Inability or Unwillingness to Protect When harm is inflicted by private actors, an applicant must show that the ““Hondurans who have took steps to oppose Los Chi government was “unwilling” to protect them. Afriyie v. Holder, 613 F:3d 924, 931 (9 Cir. 2010). Honduras is one of the most violent countries in the world. (Tab Z, Pe. 216-217). Most murders in the country are linked to organized crime. (/d.). The country condition reports indicate that the government of Honduras is unable or unwilling to protect Similar to the previously argued social grouping. “Hondurans who have took steps to oppose Los Chirizos's gang authority” is a cognizable social group.” \\t shares the immutable characteristics of nationality and pat experience je. a status that cannot be changed. Its defined with sufficient particularly s0 that i is possible o determine who falls within the group. They are #1) Hondurans (2) who have ‘opposed the Los Chirizos authority and (3) lack government protection. Last, forthe same reasons as listed. in te prior social group. the grouping is socially distinct within Honduran saciety. 24 individuals 1k¢MQMB from the gangs that want to harm them. Highlights of some country conditions evidence include: © The US Department of State OSAC report found “t]he government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases, and police often lack vhices/fel respond to calls for assistance. This means police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or may not respond at all. As a result, criminals operate with a high degree of impunity. Pg. 246). This same report also found that “(t]he majority of serious crimes...are never solved. ‘© Dr. Ubaldo Herrera Coello found in his expert opinion that in Honduras “corruption and collusion between police and gangs is so widespread that presenting a complaint to the police often constitutes a death sentence.” (Tab W, Pg. 130) ‘An International Law Journal Report “Gangs Violence and Victims in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras reported that: “gang members refer to police officers as ‘uniformed gang members’ and that 77% of former gang members indicate that they have paid bribes to the police. There are also reports that accuse the police of extortion of the gangs. In this manner the police encourage gang members to extort more businesses and individuals. (Tab QO, Pg. 331). ‘* Freedom house in its 2015 report on Honduras found: “According to the government, approximately 80 percent of crimes committed in Honduras are never reported, and police investigate only 4 percent of reported crimes.” (Tab UU, pg. 247). ‘* According to UNHCR as to Honduras, “[T]he police reportedly do not have a permanent presence in all the urban zones where gangs operate and, where they are present, they are reportedly not unusually seen as offering a sufficient form of protection for residents who are threatened by the gangs...Moreover, the reported persistent failure of prosecutors to produce sufficient evidence to lay charges has ly resulted in many repeat offenders — including gang members—being repeatedly arrested for alleged crimes but never prosecuted, even in straightforward cases such as those involving extortion.” (Tab Z, Ps. 231). It is clear from the evidence submitted that the Honduran government would not protect @immp from Los Chirizos if retumed. 7. Relocation is Unreasonable For individuals persecuted by non-government actors, such as Qjqqggm relocation alternatives must be both safe and reasonable in light of all circumstances. 8 CER. § 1208.13(6(3); Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 28, 34-36 (BIA 2012). Intemal relocation for Kessy would neither be safe or reasonable. The record makes clear that BEBewould not be safe from Los Chirizos if she were to relocate in Honduras. Gangs like Los Chirizos have significant sophisticated communication structures to find people in hiding. (Tab Z, Pg. 227-228). As Central American gang expert Thomas Boerman puts it, “if you go to a new community everyone recognizes you as a stranger including the police officers and the gang members. It takes only a little bit of time for anyone looking for you to find you.” (Tab W, Pg.327). In addition, for $HERNPto have to relocate far away from where she was targeted from Los Chirizos would be unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in the controlling regulation and caselaw. See; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3); Knezevic v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3 1206, 1214 (9\"" Cir. 2004)(finding it “exceptionally harsh” to expect asylum applicants to start their lives over in a new town with no property, family, or home). In sum, intemal relocation for Mewm in Honduras is neither possible nor reasonable. Nothing has changed to neutralizeséamamgs fear since her departure from Honduras. ii, Eligible for Asylum due to a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution of jrizos, on Account of her imputed political opinion Persecution based on political opinion may be established where the political opinion is “imputed” to the individual by his persecutors, regardless of whether the individual actually holds such opinions. Elias-Zacarias, 502 US. 478 (1992). Determining whether statements or actions are “political” requires a fact specific context specific analysis. Martinez-Buendia v. Holder, 616 F.34 711, 716 (7 Cir. 2010). As record evidence demonstrates, gangs such as Los Chirizos are in many parts of Honduras surrogate government, or actively competing with the state/local government for territorial control. A 2016 United Nations Human Rights Commissioner's report notes that Honduran gangs “pursue a strategy of exclusive control over their home territories 26 using violence to repel other gangs or challengers” including the government. (Tab Z, Pe. 224). As para-state/local government entities, gangs have been known to “install{] gates at the entrance to neighborhoods where they review the documents of passers-by to control who is to enter” or in their zones place restrictions over the population including “when people must be in their homes, where they can walk, even the color of their hair.” (Ud. Bes, 227-228). As de facto governing bodies. the gangs hold so much influence, that uring the 2013 national elections, presidential candidates reported that they had to ask permission from the gangs to carry out political activities or hold political gatherings in the neighborhoods controlled by the gangs and pay extortion money for the privilege. (le at 225) Los Chirizos the largest “home grown gang” in Honduras follows this structure and are the de facto government in their territory. Residents within their territory are subject to and must follow the gang’s local political rules or be subject to severe penalties. As set forth in UNHCR guidelines for Honduras on Los Chirizos: The modus operandi of [Los Chiricos) is similar to that of the larger gang structures of Barrio 18 an MS. In Particular, [Los Chirizas] are reported to ‘have a well-founded reputation jor extreme violence as the means for ‘maintaining control over the inhabitants of the territories that they dominate, terrorizing the local populations into submission. Like Bario 18 and MS. the Chirizos...reportedly impose a range of rules on the population living in these territories including the rule of silence, enforce by curfews and checkpoints where inhabitants must pay to enter or leave. These gangs are reported to ‘also have forced families out of their homes and sometimes taken over the ‘house, using them as command and torture centers....The Chirizos in articular are reportedly know for brutally torturing and killing thase who defy them and leaving bodies on display in public spaces... [Las Chirizos] are also reported to react aggressively to the security services, killing police “officers and their families who live in the zones under their control or forcing them to leave their homes, (Id, at 227.). In Honduras, to dare to defy a gang such as Los Chirizos through refusal to comply with specific demands, not pay taxes, or not comply to the rules imposed by the 27 ‘gangs is rare and sharply noted, both by Honduran society and by the gangs themselves. To engage in such activities is considered an act of political defiance to the gang's de facto governing authority and therefore can be the basis of an imputed political opinion.> ‘The 7 Circuit has found that persistent refusal in face of increasingly violent persecution can be an expression of an imputed political opinion. Martinez-Buendia v. Holder, 676 F.3d 711, 716 (7 Cit. 2010)."
,"In Martinez-Buendia, Ms. Martinez had refused demands given by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (commonly known as the \""FARC” to give them public credit for the humanitarian work she was doing in rural community's. At first, the FARC began their demands by making calls and leaving notes. However, as time passed, the FARC began threatening physical harm to Ms. Martinez, Buendia. They kidnapped her sister-in-law and at one point threatened Ms. Martinez Buendia by putting a gun to her head. In finding an anti-FARC imputed political opinion, the court put great deference in the fact that even after Ms. Martinez Buendia had suffered violent persecution, she continued to defy the FARC. Here, Simm similar to Ms. Martinez Buedia, repeatedly defied Los Chirizos by not paying her taxes and not following their agenda—despite facing increasingly violent persecution. ‘When they sent people to collect money from her, she told them they had the wrong place. When. the gang harassed lily by the phone, she changed her number repeatedly. After multiple death ' ‘According to UNHCR’s egal assssinent of potential sk profiles for Honduran asylum seekers in need of international protection under Arcle 1A of the 1951 Convention, “it would frequently be appropriate for... Applicants who fice gang-elsted forms of persecution to be analyzed in relation to the _r0up of (imputed) politcal opinion...Tab Z, °g. 234). Indeed, UNHCR notes, In Honduras, expressing ‘objections tothe activities of gangs may be considered as amounting to an opinion that is critical ofthe methods and policies of those in control and, thus. const thin the meaning ofthe refugee definition. (1d!) For example. individuals who resist being recruited by a gang, or who refuse to comply with demands made by the gangs. such as demands to pay extortion money, may be perceived to hold a political opinion 1d.) threats she temporarily succumb to their demands, but eventually stopped paying them. ‘aa refusal to pay after multiple death threats from the gang marked her as antithetical with the gang's desire to enforce total compliance and authority with their “t /\"" and a political enemy to be eliminated. Thus, leading the gang to attempt to murder her but killing her sister-in-law instead, While the origin iment of the gang at first was motivated by a non-persecutory desire to gain wealth, the gangs desire shifted to something at odds with financial gain i.e. punishment by death due to her imputed political opposition of the gangs control of the land. iii, Mis Eligible for Asylum due to a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution on ome of her membership in the particular social group “family members @4MM can also establish an independent claim for asylum based upon a well- founded fear of persecution on account of her being a member of the particular social group “Family members of Sa SmAnnOUrmang 1. Fear of Future Persecution Under the definition of refugee at INA § 101(a)(42) an applicant can establish eligibility as a refugee even if he or she had not actually suffered persecution in the past. Rather, an applicant can establish eligibility based on a “well-founded” fear of future persecution, To establish reasonable fear, the BIA elucidates a four-part test: 1) whether the applicant is in possession of a protected characteristic, 2) whether the persecutor is aware that the applicant possesses the characteristic, 3) whether the persecutor has the capability of punishing the applicant and 4) whether the persecutor has the inclination to punish the applicant. See; Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). eam can establish the four prongs of the modified Mogharrabi test. Through credible testimony and evidence submitted, Kessy has established that she is the 29 granddaughter of Casta Ines Murrillo Hernandez and that she had lived with her grandmother during the majority of her childhood. As set forth in (@amlMbaffidavit, her great uncle HaMNWEROUNIND Sr. and his family (perpetrators) where aware ofeidamans relationship to her grandmother. (Tab A, Pgs. 1-14). The applicant's feared persecutors, members of the 4atastdamitiaate family, have the intention and capability of harming ‘ammp as indicated by the past harm they have inflicted on her other family members including the murder of two of her uncles. Furthermore, by vowing to killediastasiamp (SSENNONNENNENOMBand all of her family, the persecutors have established an inclination to targetsiiamgg Last, @immmyés own credible testimony and country conditions evidence that police are ineffective and corrupt in Honduras and would not protect her. Specifically, country conditions for Honduras show. Among the most serious human rights problems were corruption, intimidation, and institutional weakness of the justice system leading to spread impunity. Corruption and impunity continue to be serious problems within the security forces. (Tab TT. Pe. 341). The government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases, and police often lack vehiclesffuel 10 respond to calls for assistance. This ‘means police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or ‘may not respond at all. As a result, criminals operate with a high degree of impunity, (Tab AA, Pe. 245). This same report also found that “[t]he ‘majority of serious crimes...are never solved. “Family members feGemmimnbiemnidiesiommamis” is a cognizable social group. In applying the three-part BIA test, the applicant is the blood relative of diaaidmdaiaty ERSFONNNER This is an immutable characteristic that she cannot change. Second, it is possible to determine who falls within the group defined as “family members of Game EiNS Forily membership is clearly definable. It requires 30 either @ blood or marriage relationship. Families are also limited in size and form the nucleus of other social organizations and are guarded by social taboos and legal recognition. Third, “family members f UY.” is socially distinct from the Honduran population at large. In virtually every society, a family consisting of spouses, children, parents. grandparents. cousins, aunts and uncles is viewed by society as socially distinct. ‘Thus, courts have determined that family membership is a cognizable social group when the family relationship is at leait one central reason for the claimed harm. See; Ayele v, Holder, 564 F.3d 862, 869 (7th Cir. 2009); Matter of L-E-A-, 27 1&N Dec. 40 (BIA 2017). Moreover, datananbiat ORO: family motive to target@Mllpcan be ascertained by the evidence submitted. In the past ¢ummaphstumatiingigg s family has attacked similarly situated family members f (Ane The perpetrators also made it known throughout town that they would not stop until they killed QUA Hemandez and her entire family. Thus, a nexus fos family’s motive can be readily established. Moreover, Los Chirizos motive is not that of financial reasoning but is rather to harm the Applicant because of her relationship to her ‘grandmother. Thus, making this case factually distinct from Matter of L-E-A, 27 1&N Dec. 40 (BIA 2017). iv, Alternatively, Kessy is entitled to Humanitarian Asylum Should this Court find that the DHS has met its burden of rebutting the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution, or reasonable location alternatives, Kessy asserts that she is eligible for humanitarian asylum. A grant of humanitarian 31 asylum is appropriate if the respondent can demonstrate compelling reasons for being ‘unwilling or unable to return to her horse country, and these circumstances arise out of the severity of the past persecution. See 8 C.F.R. §1208.13(b)(1)(ii)(A); Matter of Chen, 20 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1989). (@gmmm suffered prolonged and constant harassment and death threats from Los Chirizos. The Chirizos have shown their wiliness to commit violence by burning to death a nearby business owner and his family as well as attempting to assassinate M0Nmp but killing her sister-in-law instead. As a result of this constant risk of torture and death, Bp continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. (Tab V, Pg, 101). As such, gp has suffered atrocious harm and she qualifies for a grant of humanitarian asylum. v. Derivative Respondent Kenneth A. Canales-Gradis is eligible or asylum due to a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution on Account of her membership in the particular social group “Family Members of Kessy Gradis-Zoto” (BB son Kenneth can also establish an independent claim for asylum based upon a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his being a member of the particular social group “Family member, f ao? 1. Fear of Future Persecution based upon protected ground déwranty can establish the four prongs of the modified Mogharrabi test. Evidence shows that(@Gmanaiy is the son oftilliygand that Los Chirizos is aware of this. Evidence also shows that Los Chirizos has the ability and willingness to attacleamaaml@. As set forth in SHMN’s affidavit, Los Chirizos has on multiple occasions threatened SINR that they will burn @smmmmgh alive with her. (Tab A, Pg. 8). Country conditions support that Honduras is a lawless land with high murder rates that are often unsolved. (Tab AA &, ‘Pg. 244, 246). Country conditions also support that murder for hire is not uncommon. (Id. 32 ‘at 245). Last, the evidence shows that one central motive of Los Chitizos is targeting (GBB due to his family relationship cm vi, Respondent Sshould Not Be Statutorily Barred From Asylum and Merits Favorable Exercise of Discretion Although imp filed her application after one year of her last entry, she was never informed of the one-year deadline from the Department of Homeland Security and is therefore a class member under Mendez Rojas v. Johnson, 2018 WL 1532715 (W.D. Wash. March 29 2018). Therefore, this Court should accept (Img§I@ I-589 as timely filed. In Mendez, the court found that the government's failure to provide adequate notice of the one-year deadline for asylum applicants constitutes a violation of the immigration statute, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and class members’ due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Under the Judge's order DHS has until July 27, 2018, 10 adopt, publicize, and immediately implement uniform procedural ‘mechanisms that will ensure class members are able to file their asylum applications in a timely manner. Moreover, per the Courts order, the government must accept timely filed an asylum application that is filed by a class member within one year of the government's adoption of the new notice of their one-year deadline, including those applications by class members filed before the court's order but after more than a year after their arrival in the United States. A favorable exercise of discretion is also warranted in this case. In determining whether an application merits a favorable exercise of discretion, an Immigration Judge % Kessy isa Class A.II. class member under Mendez Rojas, Class A.II. member are all individuals who are in removal proceedings and who either (a) have not yet applied for asylum or (b) applied for asylum after fone year of ther last arrival. 33 must consider the totality of the circumstances, balancing the fact the applicant qualifies as a refugee, along with other factors against any negative factors. See; Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 1987). Here, the positive factors clearly outweigh that of the negative and discretion is warranted. B, @WwMis Eligible for Withholding of Removal Due to a Clear Probability of Persecution in Honduras. Withholding is mandatory when an alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. INA §241(b)(3). As with asylum, discussed supra in Part A, Gil is entitled to the presumption that she is eligible for withholding of removal because she suffered past persecution on account of her membership in the particular social group “Honduran business owners who have refused to pay war tax” “Hondurans taking concrete steps to oppose Los Chirizos gang members and gang authority” or in the altemative “Family members of Casta Ines Murrillo Hernandez” which the govemment cannot rebut by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 CFR. § 1208.16(b)(1)(). The testimony of Gimp along with the extensive and credible country conditions evidence, meets the higher threshold for the likelihood of future harm that will befallgiimmgy if returned. Moreover Mllgpis not disqualified from a grant of withholding of removal under any statutory ground. Accordingly, Kessy is entitled to withholding of removal, In addition, her son (QM can also establish an independent claim for withholding based on a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in the particular social group “Family members of (a_i The 34 record reflects that (QE will most likely be killed if returned to Honduras by Los Chirizos. C. Respondents are entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture ‘Under the Convention Against Torture, applicants like ®@lliy and @iNli@e are entitled to CAT relief if they show that they are more likely than not to be tortured upon removal. 8 CER § 1208.16(c)(2), (4). If the agent inflicting the torture is a private, actor, the applicant must prove govemment consent or acquiescence to torture. 8 CFR. § 1208.18(aX(1). First, the harm (map and@igmmmp fear if returned to Honduras, death or grave bodily injury, meets the definition of torture.” The mental suffering component of the CER. definition of torture also includes the threat of imminent death or the threat that another person will imminently be subject to death. See; 8 CFR § 208.18(a)(4). In addition, the record shows that Los Chirizos motive to inflict said torture is to punish MW for her perceived defiance of the gang which also falls within the definition of torture. Id. Finally, like other members of society who have challenged gangs de facto authority, Los Chirizos targeting qilmmg for torture operates with the consent or acquiescence of the Honduran government. (See 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1) and (6)). Corruption is a serious and pervasive problem in Honduras and it enables gangs to act with complete impunity. 260-261). In addition, country condition evidence impunity. 7 Torture” i defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is itertionally inficed on a person of a third person forthe purpose of (1) obtaining information or a confession, (2) punishing him for an act committed or suspected of having been commited by him or a third. person (3) intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or (4) for any reason based on Aliscrimination of any kind, 8 CER. § 208.18(1) 35 shows the type of violence §§§um has and will experience is often directed by or with the direct acknowledgment of government officials. Excerpts from a few of the multiple scholarly reports included as evidence on this issue provide: © As one leader of a major bus company in Tegucigalpa --as related to extortion-- Buus it: “itis clear to [him] that police only go after independent groups, avoiding capture and prosecution of the big three: MS13, Barrio 18 and Chirizos. [He] theorize(s] that the police commanders and these officials take their cut of the extortion pie. CLab BB, Pg. 249) + In Honduras gang memiers refer to police offices as “uniformed gang members.” 77% of former gang members indicate that they paid bribes to the police. Also, multiple reports accuse the police of extortion of the gangs. In this manner the police encourage gang members to extort more businesses and individuals. (Tab RRPg. 33). © “The Honduran police cannot be considered a reliable institution to which citizens who are threatened or who have become victims of violence and crime ‘could turn to. Rather, many parts of the police must be considered criminal organizations themselves.” (Tab VV, Pg. 253) ‘© “Many Hondurans fear to seek protection of the police, because they - in many ‘cases rightly - believe that the police are colluding with the criminal organizations or other individual aggressors who are threatening them.” (Id). ‘© “[cJorruption and impunity continued to be serious problems within the security forces. Some members of the police participated in crimes with local and international criminal organizations.” (Tab WW, Pe 253) ‘* [EJsxtortion rackets are conducted in coordination with government officials or the Police” (Tab CC, Pg. 255) Accordingly, the respondents ——iisionp ond Czy (@@BW merit protection under the Convention Against Torture. Iv. CONCLUSION Respondents are eligible for and should be granted their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. As established herein, the Respondents Adama dsiimammp have demonstrated a well-founded fear of 36 persecution on account of their membership in a particular social group or on account of their imputed political opinion. WHEREFORE, the Respondents, through Counsel, respectfully requests that the Court exercise its discretion and grant their applications for asylum. In the alternative, they are entitled to withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture protection, and for any other relief this Court deems just and necessary.

The court took notice ofthe report without objection from either party 3 In 2012, the lead respondent became pregnant again. {I continued to abuse her throughout the pregnancy. He would throw her on the floor and hit her on the back. The lead respondent went to the hospital due to the abuse and she was advised that she was in danger of misoarrying, In November 2012, she gave birth to a daughter who only lived for sixteen hours. The baby had bruises all over her body and the doctors questioned whether the lead respondent had been abused during the pregnancy. After the death of their daughter, &jigg§ apologized to the lead respondent and promised that he would change. However, eventually the abuse began again. In June 2013, the lead respondent reported to the police. She testified in court about the abuse perpetrated by He was found guilty, sentenced to community service, and she was given a restraining order against him. However, (MMB did not complete the community service as he told the lead respondent that he paid the police to get out of it. After the trial, the lead respondent stayed with a friend but [MM continued to follow her ignoring the protective order. Eventually, the lead respondent went back to live with I because he continued to threaten her and the people with whom she was living. When the lead respondent's cousin had a baby, she asked MIMI if she could go visit her cousin. He refused to allow her but she went anyway. When she returned, he yelled at her and beat her worse than ever before. After this, the lead respondent's aunt and cousin took her back to her aunt's house. {MMB went to her aunt’s house and threatened them. The respondent contacted a friend who suggested that the lead respondent go to Guatemala to work. The respondent lived in Guatemala for two months but she did not feel safe there and she did not have legal status there. She retumed to Honduras to get her son and then she came to the United States. ‘The lead respondent testified that her son was in danger in Honduras due to threats made by [liMWtand because of the criminal business his father, Mr. MMP was involved in. The respondent did not tell her son’s father that she was going to the United States. The lead respondent does not believe that she could live in Honduras safely. The respondent has two aunts who still live in Honduras but {i has threatened them, demanding they tell him where the lead respondent is. The lead respondent does not believe that the police would help her. Il, FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS The court finds the lead respondent has met her burden under the REAL ID Act. It further finds that she has met her burden to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, and it thus grants her application, A. Credibility Based on both the testimony and the information in the record, the court finds the lead respondent credible. Because her applications were filed after May 11, 2005, the credibility and corroboration provisions of the REAL ID Act govern the respondent's applications.’ A. respondent’s testimony alone is sufficient to satisfy her burden of proof only if the court determines that the testimony is credible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate she has satisfied her burden of proof. INA § 240(¢)(4). In the absence of documentary proof, the REAL, ID Act requires that an Immigration Judge use the details of an alien’s story to make an evaluation ofits truth. Mitondo v. Mukasey, 523 F.3d 784, 789 (7th Cir. 2008). Having reviewed the testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, the court finds that her testimony was generally consistent both internally and when compared to other evidence in the record. Accordingly, the court finds the respondent met her burden under the REAL ID Act and therefore tums to the merits of her claim, B. Asylum Under INA § 208(b), asylum may be granted to a person who is physically present in the United States if the person meets the statutory definition of a “refugee.” A “refugee” is defined as an individual who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country “because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” INA § 101(a)(42)(A). The protected ground must be “one central reason” for the persecution, but need not be the only motive behind the persecution. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Gjerazi v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 800, 812-13 (7th Cir. 2006) (describing the “mixed motives doctrine”). The respondent ultimately carries the burden of establishing statutory eligibility for asylum, See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); Torres v. Mukasey, $51 F.3d 616, 625 (7th Cir. 2008). If the respondent establishes past persecution, she is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1). 1. Past Persecution ‘The court finds that the respondent experienced past persecution on account of a particular social group and that the Honduran government was unable or unwilling to protect her. a. Level of Harm The term “persecution” denotes a high standard, requiring “powerful and moving evidence” that the harm suffered rises above mere harassment. Dandan v, Ashcroft, 339 F.3d567, 573-74 (7th Cir. 2003). It “involves the use of significant physical force against a person’s body, or the infliction of comparable physical harm without direct application of force . .. or nonphysical harm of equal gravity.” Stanojkova v. Holder, 645 F.3d 943, 948 (7th Cir. 2011); see also Yasinskyy v. Holder, 724 F.3d 983, 989 (7th Cir. 2013). Credible threats of imminent death or grave bodily harm can rise to the level of persecution. N.L.A. v. Holder, 744 F.3d 425, 431 (7th Cir. 2014). Rape can rise to the level of persecution. See Sankoh v. Mukasey, 539 F.3d 456, 471 (7th Cir. 2008). 's credibility and corroboration provisions govern applications for relief and protection made on or after May 11, 2005, See INA §§ 208(b\\(1}(B) n.65.2, 240(C)(4) n.29.3, 241(6)(3(C) 0.39.1. 5 In this case, §JMIljregularly raped the respondent and beat her so baaly that she miscarried ‘once and caused the death of a second child. The court finds that this abuse involved significant physical force and therefore the respondent established that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution. See Stanajkova, 645 F.3d at 948; Sankoh, 539 F.3d at 471, b. Nexus The lead respondent has also demonstrated the persecution she experienced in Honduras was inflicted because of her membership in the cognizable particular social group “married Honduran women who are viewed as property due to patriarchal society norms.”® For claims based on membership in a particular social group, a respondent must: (1) identify a particular social group, (2) establish that she is a member of that group, and (3) demonstrate that her group membership was one central reason for her harm amounting to persecution, Escobar v. Holder, 657 F.3d 537, 545 (7th Cir, 2011). A social group is legally cognizable when it is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, defined with particularity, and socially distinct within the’society in question. Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 319 (A.G. 2018). When the alleged persecutor is someone unaffiliated with the government, the application must also show that her home government is unwilling or unable to protect her. Id; Tarraf'v Gonzales, 495 F.3d 525, 527 n.2 (7th Cir. 2007), As an initial matter, the court finds the respondent belongs to a cognizable social group of “married Honduran women who are viewed as property due to patriarchal society norms.” The court acknowledges that the Attorney General has rejected social groups defined solely by violent domestic relationships which people are unable to leave. Maiter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dee. at 333-36. The respondent’s group, as developed through her testimony, however, presents characteristics distinct from those at issue in Matter of A-B-. Specifically, it involves the authorities accepting payment to allow {to evade his court imposed punishment and thus approving such violent means as acceptable. This is a far ery from the strictly private violence that the Attomey General ‘was concerned about in Matter of 4-B- and therefore the respondent’s group deviates from typical domestic violence cases. Under Seventh Circuit jurisprudence, the lead respondent's proposed particular social group, “married Honduran women who are viewed as property due to patriarchal society norms,” is legally cognizable. See generally Cece v. Holder, 733 F.3d 662, 669-72 (7th Cir. 2013). The Seventh Circuit has recognized the analogous social groups of “single women in Albania who live alone,” Cece, 733 F.3d at 671; “women in Jordan who have (allegedly) flouted repressive moral The court has defined the contours of the respondent's particular social group in this case pursuant to the respondent’ detailed testimony and submissions and the Seventh Circuit's opinion in Cece v, Holder, and any inconsistencies in the various iterations before the immigration court do not upset the respondent's claim. 733 F.3d 662, 670-71 (7th Ci. 2013); see also W-Y-C- & H-O-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA 2018) (emphasizing the importance of including the specific group being analyzed in the immigration judge's opinion for appellate review). ©The 7th Circuit has not yet accorded Chevron deference to the BIA's particular social group requirements of social distinction and particularity. See W.G.A. v. Sessions, 900 F.3d 957, 964 (7th Cir, 2018). Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recently noted that a petitioner's arguments had “some force” that the social distinetion and particularity parts of the Board's interpretation of the ambiguous statutory phrase, when required together, are unreasonable interpretations. Id. a1 964, 2.4 norms” Sarhan v. Holder, 658 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir, 2011); “women who fear they will be victims of female genital mutilation,” Agbor v. Gonzales, 487 F.3d 499, 502 (7th Cir. 2007); and “Christian women in Iran who do not wish to adhere to the Islamic female dress code,” Yadegar-Sargis v. INS, 297 F.3d 596, 603 (7th Cir. 2002). Of particular relevance is the Sarhan court’s reasoning for recognizing group status for Jordanian women who have flouted repressive moral norms. There, the Seventh Circuit concluded that women whose families are targeting them for death because they allegedly violated pre- existing moral and social norms in Jordan, collectively, form a group that shares immutable charactéristics. Sarhan, 658 F.3d at 654-56. It explained that these women are unable to “shed the stigmatizing characteristics that render them victims.” Jd. at 655. The Seventh Circuit also rejected the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (“Board”) conclusion that this group had little or nothing in common besides being targets. Id. To the contrary, the Seventh Circuit stressed that this social group “is a function of a pre-existing moral code in Jordanian society.” Id. It also explained that these women form a cohesive group, suggesting that the group is defined with particularity, Sarhan, 658 F.3d at 655. The lead respondent's characteristics here are similar to those considered and approved in Sarhan. The lead respondent’ testimony and the reports in the record indicate that the patriarchal society in Honduras labels women as property. In its report on human rights in Honduras, the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights (“IACHR®) states that a female magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justice indicated that “violence against women is considered as something natural.” Exh. 3, Tab N at 235. According to Claudia Herrmannsdorfer, “the culture of machismo pervades Honduras. Machismo teaches that women are property of their intimate partners.” Exh. 3, Tab J at 99. As with Jordanian women considered in Sarhan, the lead respondent has the immutable characteristic of gender, nationality, and inability to alter society’s perception of her. ‘The lead respondent’s social group is a function of the patriarchal norms in Honduran society, just as the pre-existing moral code in Jordan defined the social group in Sarhan and the dress code for women defined the social group in Yadegar-Sarsis. Additionally, the court finds that the lead respondent suffered persecution on account of her membership in the particular social group. {iB treated the lead respondent like his property by refusing to let her leave the house and forcing her to do the cleaning, laundry, and cooking for the household. Qs mother was also aware of the abuse but she did nothing to prevent it or to help the Jead respondent. This circumstantial evidence shows that IB, and other members of Honduran society, were aware of the lead respondent’s membership in the asserted particular social group, and that [ili targeted her because of this group membership. See Elias-Zacarias, 502 USS. at 483; Martinez-Buendia v. Holder, 616 F.3d 711, 715 (7th Cir. 2010); Gjerazi v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 800, 812-13 (7th Cir. 2006). c, Unable or Unwilling to Protect ‘To demonstrate that she was persecuted within the meaning of the law, a respondent must show that the harm she faced was either at the hands of the government or that the government was unable or unwilling to protect her from the responsible parties. Tarraf'v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 525, 527 n.2 (7th Cir. 2007). Where an alleged persecutor is a private actor, a respondent bears the burden of showing that the government of the country of removal was either unable or unwilling to protect her. Jonaitiene v. Holder, 660 F.3d 267, 270 (7th Cir. 2011). Here, the respondent demonstrated that the Honduran government was unwilling or unable to protect her from domestic violence. After several years of abuse and the loss of two babies, the respondent did file a complaint against She received a restraining order against him and he was given six months of community service. However, Mijiptold the respondent that he was able to pay the authorities so that he did not have to complete his court imposed punishment. And despite the restraining order, he continued to follow her and harass her, eventually making her live with him again. In this case, the lead respondent established that the government condoned the private actions of her husband by not requiring (jgjBto complete his sentence that he was giving for harming the lead respondent. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N at 337. Country conditions evidence in the record confirms that reporting instances of domestic violence is often ineffective and there are high rates of impunity for perpetrators of violence against women, See Exh. 3, Tabs N-O. In its report on human rights in Honduras, the ACHR states that “judicial ineffectiveness in cases involving violence against women creates a climate conducive to violence and discrimination against women ‘since society sees no evidence of willingness by the State, as the representative of the society, to take effective action to sanction such acts.”” Exh. 3, Tab N at 240. In sum, the lead respondent has demonstrated that she experienced past harm that rose to the level of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group and that the Honduran government was unable or unwilling to protect her. As such, she has established that she experienced past persecution, 2. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Because the respondent established past persecution, she is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that her fear of future persecution is “well-founded.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208,13(6)(1). DHS ‘can rebut this presumption if a preponderance of the evidence shows either: (1) that there has been a “fundamental change in circumstances such that the respondent no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution” in her native country; or (2) that she “could avoid persecution by relocating to another part” of the country and that “it would be reasonable to expect [her] to do so.” 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)-(ii); see also Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 450-51 (BIA 2008). First, the court finds that DHS has not demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances such that the respondent no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution. DHS has not established any change in Honduras that would indicate that sexual and gender-based violence significantly decreased or that the Honduran government now effectively protects victims of such violence. See Exh, 3, Tabs M-O. Likewise, DHS did not demonstrate that IMM would no longer be interested in the respondent if she returned to Honduras, particularly given that he continued to look for her after she left. Second, DHS did not demonstrate that the respondent could reasonably relocate within Honduras to avoid harm from {jp The respondent testified that she did attempt to relocate at two different aunts’ houses; however, QJM found her at both locations. As such, DHS has not rebutted the presumption that the respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group. Thus, the court will grant her asylum application. IV. CONCLUSION The court concludes that the respondent has met her burden to show eligibility for asylum under INA § 208. Because the respondent’s minor child is a rider to her asylum application, her child is granted asylum as well. Accordingly, the following order will be entered: ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the lead respondent's application for asylum be GRANTED. [ ~ Joy a ELIZABRDH G.

Hofstre Law Clinic Assistant Chief Counsel 108 Hofstra University 290 Broadway Hempstead, NY 11549 ‘New York, NY 10007 DECISION AND ORDERS OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE I PROCEDURAL HISTORY respondent’) is a male, native and citizen of El Salvador. Exhibit (Exh) 1. He alleges entry into the United Stetes (“U.S,”) at an unknown place on July 12, 2006. Exh, 3. On September 15, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (the Department” or “DHS\"") served a Form 1-862, Notice to Appear (*NTA”), upon the Varick Immigration Court, charging respondent with removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6\\(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA”), as an alien present in the U.S. without admission or parole, or who arrived in the U.S. at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. This commenced removal proceedings against respondent. Ia. While in: DHS custody, respondent filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained from him during his encounter with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office and shared with DHS on August 9, 2017, as well as any additional evidence arising from the allegedly itlegally obtained evidence 1 CMTS\""). DHS opposed suppression. On December 1, 2017, a prior Immigration Judge denied respondent's motion to suppress the aforementioned information and terminate these proceedings. Respondent filed an interlocutory appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA” ot “Board”. The Board declined to address the appeal by order dated March 7, 2018, Respondent renewed that motion before the instant court following his release from DHS custody and change of venue. tthe December !, 2017, respondent filed an admittedly untimely Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (“asylum application”), including a claim for withholding of removal under Article II of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (°CAT”) with the Varick Immigration Court. The Court found Respondent removable as charged, based on evidence filed by DHS. id Removability was therefore established by clear and convincing evidence, See INA § 240(c)(2)(B). Respondent declined to designate a country of removal. The court, upon the Department's recommendation, designated BI Salvador for that purpose, Following his release from custody, respondent appeared before this court on February 26, 2020, for a merits hearing. For the reasons that follow, respondent’s motion to suppress and terminate will be denied. His asylum application will be granted. Il, MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND TERMINATE A motion to suppress is used to challenge admissibility of evidence and may be granted ‘when it is supported by a specific and detailed statement based on personal knowledge that establishes a prima fucie case for suppression, Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dee. 609, 611 (BIA 1988). To set forth a prima facie case, the applicant bears the burden to assert a basis for suppression and must enumerate the articles to be suppressed. Matter of Wong, 13 1&N Dec. 820, 821-22 (BIA 1971); see also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 1&N Dec, 503, 505 (BIA 1980); Matter of Tang, 13 1&N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971). Ifthe affidavit is such that the facts alleged, if true, could support « basis for excluding the evidence in question, then the claims must also be supported by testimony. fd. at 611-12 (emphasis added); Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 125 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Maldonado v. Holder, 763 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2014) (If a respondent “provide[s] an affidavit that, faken as true, ‘could support a basis for excluding the evidence,” the respondent “is entitled to ‘an opportunity to confirm those allegations in an evidentiary hearing.” ); see also Cotzojay v. Holder, 725 F.3d 172, 179 (2d Cir. 2013). If.a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to DHS to justify the manner in which it obtained the evidence at issue, Matter of Burgos, 15 I&N Dee, 278, 279 (BIA 1975). DHS’s failure to justify the conduct of its agents resolves the issue in favor of suppression. Matter of Tang, 13 1&N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971). A. Fourth Amendment Violation Generally, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply in removal proceedings unless the alleged violations are so “egregious” as to “transgress notions of fundamental fairness” the use of that evidence would violate the Fifth Amendment requirement of due process. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040-51 (1984); Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 124 (2d Cir, 2018). Consequently, evidence obtained pursuant to an egregious Fourth Amendment violation can be suppressed under the Fifth Amendment. Melnitsenko v, Mukasey, $17 F.3d 42, 47-48 (2d Cit. 2008). In the Second Circuit, suppression may be warranted under the Fourth Amendment when the evidence indicates “either (a) that an egregious violation that was fundamentally unfair has occurred, or (b) that the violation—regardless of its egregiousness or unfaimess—undermine(s] the reliability of the evidence in dispute.” Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 441 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Almeida-Amaral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2006)); Zuniga-Perez, 897 F.3d at 124. The first prong, set forth in Rajah and Almeida-Amaral, implicates the Fifth Amendment in that suppression is only warranted when evidence is obtained pursuant to an egregious Fourth Amendment violation which “transgyess{es} the fundamental notions of “fair play” that animate the Fifth Amendment.” Rajah, 544 Fi3d at 441; Matter of Toro, 17 1&N Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980) (egregious Fourth Amendment violation may render evidence inadmissible under the due process clause); Matter of Garcia, 17 1&N’Dec. 319, 320 (BIA 1980) (holding that statements given Woluntarily should be suppressed under the due process standard); see, e.g., United States v. Isiofia, 370 F.3d 226, 234-35 (2d Cir. 2004) (suppressing evidence of defendant's identity because he had not given voluntary consent for search of his home, where his passport was seized); ‘Meinitsenko, $17 F.3d at 47-48 (finding no Fourth Amendment violation where petitioner was stopped by DHS 107 miles from the Canadian border and interrogated, fingerprinted, and photographed for three hours with no Miranda warnings); Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 179 (finding that Petitioner had established a prima facie case of non-consensual warrantless entry into his home by ICE officers and that the ICE officers’ alleged conduct amounted to egregious Fourth Amendment violation). ‘The Second Circuit has cautioned that “the egregiousness of a constitutional violation cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the validity (or invalidity) of the stop, but must also be based on the characteristies and severity of the offending conduct.” Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 124 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Almeida-Amaral, 461 F.3d at 235). Factors to consider in determining whether that there was an egregious violation include “whether the violation was intentional; whether the seizure was gross or unreasonable, and without plausible legal ground; ‘whether the invasion involved threags, coercion, physical abuse or unreasonable shows of force; and whether the seizure or arrest was based on race or ethnicity.” Id. (quoting Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 182) (internal quotation marks omitted). A seizure may be an egregious violation, even when it is not “especially severe,” if the seizure was “based on race (or some other grossly improper ration).” Zuniga-Perez, 897 F.3d at 124 (quoting Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 181). However, jurisdictional identity evidence, such as an individual’s name, is not suppressible under the Fourth Amendment, even if it was obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation, Lopez-Mendoza, 468 USS, at 1039-40; Pretzantzin, 725 F.3d at 650-51; Katris v. INS, 562 F.2d 866, 869 (2d Cir. 1977); see also Zerrei v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 342, 346 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding admission of copy of alien’s passport did not violate alien’s due process rights because the alien never objected to its submission and it was treated as authentic by alien's counsel); see also Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 1&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (finding that the “identity of an alien is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arvest.\""). In Pretzantzin v. Holder, the Second Circuit joined the Fourth, Eighth and Tenth Circuits in holding that Lopez~ Mendoza merely confirmed the long-standing jurisdictional rule that an unlawful arrest has no bearing on the validity of a subsequeftt proceeding; it did not create an evidentiary rule insulating spevific pieces of identity-related evidence from suppression. 725 F.34 641, 647 (2d Cir, 2013). Accordingly, the Second Circuit held that the BIA erred in concluding that the government had met its burden of establishing that cert@in alienage-related eviderice had been obtained independent of any constitutional violation. Pretsantzin, 736 F.3d at 652. B. Regulatory Violations ‘When an agency violates its own regulations prior tothe initiation of removal proceedings, the relevant inquiry is whether “DHS's error implicated a fundamental right.” Nolasco ». Holder, 637 F.3d 159, 165 @d Cit, 2011)., Pre-heating regulatory violations are not grounds for termination “absent prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience- shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.” Rojah, $44 F.3d at 447. Where a regulation was promulgated to protect a due process right, such as the “right ... to receive notice provided for in the NTA,” but “itis clear that the . .. alien received such notice, she has no due process claim, regardless of any technical defect in the manncr in which the NT‘ has been served.” Nolasco, 637 3d at 164, Where a regulatory violation does not affect a fundamental right, the proceeding should be invalidated only if petitioner shows that the “infraction affected cither the outcome or the overall fairness of the proceeding.” See Montero v, INS, 124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Waldron v, INS, 17 F.3d S11, $18 (2d Cir, 1993) (noting that, where no regulation violates a fundamental right, it “is best to invalidate a challenged proceeding only upon 1 showing of prejudice to the rights ‘sought to be protected by the subject regulation”). In the absence of such prejudice, termination would “place an unwarranted and potentially unworkable bburden on the government’s adjudication of immigration cases.” Waldron, 17 F.3d at 318, CC. Analysis : Respondent argues that he was subject to an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights during his late nightearly méming encounter with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office ('SCSO\"") at a bar called in Patchogue, New Yor Specifically, according to Respondent, the Suffolk County police officers, along with the ICE agents, egregiously violated his Fourth Amendment rights because he was detained and questioned along with the other patzans primarily due to their Latino heritage and their clothing. See MTS at 4-5. Therefore, any evidence and testimony obtained from the Respondent's arrest should be suppressed. See id. Respofdent indicates that he went to ME around 11:00 p.m. Exh. 2. Approximately 15 minutes later, 20 officers fiom the Suffolk County police department entered the bar and stated that they were looking for a known gang member and asked everyone. present for identification (“ID\""), 1d, Respondent gave them his Salvadoran identity card because the officers were not allowing ary @f the patrons fo leave without showing their IDs. Id. The police officers took respondent's ID,and asked him to speak to ICE agents who were standing outside of the bar. 1d, The agents questioned respondent about his work history, how often he patronized IEEE and how long he had been in the U.S. Jd, ‘The agents asked respondent if he was a gang member and asked hisn to remove his shirt so that they could look for tattoos. Id. They also took photographs of his uffper body. Id. Respondent was then sent back inside where hhe was again asked to temove his shigt, belt and shoes. [d, He was arrested by ICE around 3:00 ‘a.m. and put into an ICE van. Id. H@ was then informed that he was under arrest based upon his immigration status. Id. The ICE agests then further questioned him about that status, 1d. DHS argues that even thougiithe Suffolk County police officers did not have a warrant to inspect the bar in question, they {Gould do so because courts have long recognized that administrative inspections of closely;regulated businesses, such as bars and the liquor industry, fail within the rcasonable exceptiortto the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment. Respondent argues that the warranjless administrative inspections exception only applies to ‘commercial properties and does not @ircumvent Fourth Amendment privacy rights of individuals. Furthermore, an administrative inspeetion cannot be used as a pretext for a warrantless search. ‘The Court recognizes that respondent has presented some valid arguments regarding the scope of a warrantless search, Howeyer, he did not establish that he was detained along with the other patrons primarily because of his racial heritage. The background evidence submitted by DHS shows that law enforcement officials so because it was considered a public nuisance and was a known MS-13 hangout, See Exh, LA, tab E, The building itself was not structurally sound and was condemned after this incident. ‘The police themselves indicated to respondent that they were also looking for a particular gang member and released other patrons after they showed satisfactory identification documents, apparently regardless of their heritage. Further, while respondent assumes that all of the other patrons of the bar were of Latino heritage, there is no factual besis to support that assertion, Even assuming that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred because respondent wos not suspected of committing any crimeés*when Suffolk County police officers asked him for his identification and they did not have agyarrant to search for any specific individuals associated with the gang, the Court cannot conclude that any such violation was an egregious one, The growing presence of MS-13 poses a serious+danger to public safety in many parts of New York and especially on Long Isiand, in Suffat:County, Our society has a very real interest in addressing the problems posed by MS-13. Again, the background evidence also shows that (IEE along with another bar, was raided by law enforcement officers because of both administrative violations and known gang presence, Exh, 1A,Tab B, Cf. Rodriguez v. Barr, 943 F.3d 134 (2d Cir, 2019) (inference that the respondent's arrest was racially based where it occurred during a raid on a Hispanic neighborhood, in violation gf ICE policy and where officers’ comments revealed a racial animus as motivation for the raid). Akthe conclusion of the raids, both bazs were closed down and condemned, seven people were arrested on criminal charges and two were arrested by ICE agents for immigration violations. See id: Here, the evidence indicates that rather than targeting individuals of Latino heritage, law enforcement officers were targeting members of the MS-13. gang. While meny, if not most of the MS-13 gang members on Long Island may be of Latino heritage, the police would likely arré8t any known or suspected gang member, regardless of their ethnic heritage, * Respondent also argues that-DHS violated 8 C.P.R. § 287.8(6)(1), which states that immigration officers may pose quest{ins to anyone in consensual encounters as long as they do not restrain the freedom of the personfo walk away. DHS argues that Respondent has not provided any evidence to show that the ICE agents restrained his freedom. However, respondent indicates that the police officers kept his ID and/asked him to speak to ICE agents. It seems unlikely that someone in the Respondent’s situatiorwould think that it is reasonable to walk away from the ICE agents without first speaking to tha, such that a regulatory violation could have ocourred, Respondent also argues that ICE agents violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(b)(2), which allows immigration officers to briefly detain persons for fuestioning when they have a reasonable suspicion that the subject is an alien illegally in the U.S; | Respondent asserts that he was kept at the bar for several hours and was then arrested and plaép in ICE custody. Respondent did not establish that DHS violated this regulation because ICE,Agents were aware that he gave the police a Salvadoran ID card, which gave rise to a reasonable'suspicion that the Respondent could be in the U.S, without authorization or legal status. ? Novertheless, even if ICE agents did violate 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(b)(1), the Court does not find that termination is appropriate hee. Under Rajah, termination of proceedings is not warranted unless there is “prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience- shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.” d, ICE's conduet does not fall into any of these categories. Respondent was present ina bar, which police officers have identified as a public nuisance and a known hangout for MS-13 gang members, He gave the police officers his Salvadoran ID card when they demanded IDs from all of the bar patrons, Subsequently, the ICE, agents questioned him based on the’suspicion that he was in the U.S. without authorization. Respondent himself admitted that other patrons who were not suspected of violating any criminal ‘or immigrations laws were allowed to leave the bar after the police checked their IDs. Under these circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that even if there was any regulatory violation that it was sufficiently egregious to warrant suppression of any evidence or termination of the removal proceedings,’ Q HL ASYLUM, WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL AND CAT PROTECTION A. Summary of Claim The parties stipulated that reifondent filed a credible asylum claim. See Matter of Fefe, 20 I&N Dec. 116 (BIA 1989). Therefore, this summary is derived from the documentary record. Having made this finding, the Court declines to reach DHS's argument regarding independent evidence of respondent’ alienage. See eg, Matter of A-B-, 27 1 & N Dee, 316,340 (A.G. 2018) (where an asylum application is fundamentally flawed in one respect, the ifamigration judge need not consider remainder of claim). 6 y Ls Respondent indicates that he entered the US. in or about April of 2006. Exh. 6. Prior to his departure from El Salvador, he ang his family members were extorted and threatened by gang members. Exh. 4, Tab A. Respondent was also targeted by the gang for recruitment. His sister ‘was once beaten by gang members. n one occasion, respondent was stabbed in the stomach by a gang member who was extorting him, 7d, He did not seek medical treatment or report this stabbing to the police because he felt the police would not assist him. Respondent does not indicate in his most recent statement why he djd not apply for asylum within one year of his entry, although he experienced a stabbing shortly before his departure from El Salvador. Exh. 6, Respondent applied for asylurh after he was detained by DHS. He was motivated to do so because he learned while detained that he had been labeled a gang member by U.S. authorities,” Respondent also learned that a cous} of his, who had joined « gang, was killed shortly after he was deported to BI Salvador from the U.S. He also indicates that other members of his family ‘were targeted for extortion since he Game to the U.S., and his brother was threatened with a gun ‘when he moved back to El Salvador. Exh. 6, p. 8. No specific dates are provided for these latter two events, es Respondent is afraid to return to Bl Salvador because his attorneys told him that if he is deported, the U.S. government will inform Salvadoran officials that he is a gang member. Exh, 4, Tab A, p. 1. Many parties, including:the police, the military, vigilante groups and rivel gangs all wish to kill gang members. ° Resporident believes that no one can protect him in El Salvador ‘because many police and government officials are corrupt and work with the gangs. B. Expert Testimony ¥ Respondent presented the testimépy of an expert on country conditions in El Salvador, Dr. Thomas J, Boerman.? See Exh, 5. He'explained that E! Selvador is a country roughly the same size as the state of Massachusetts. It as approximetely 60-65,000 gang members and millions of sympathizers. ‘The country is divided between the MS-13 and Mara-18 gangs. Over the past twenty years, the Salvadoran government's response to gangs has been high high-profile, visible government poligy and logislation, known es the Mano Dura, or Iron Fist. It includes a police and military suppression strategy, and extensive, enhanced prison sentences. ‘According to Dr. Boerman, there is erimity and animosity between the police and military and the gangs, who kill each other “left ayd right,” but on the other hand they have a symbiotic relationship. The gangs are recognizéd as political actors, “tiptoeing around the edges,” and they can distupt raltis, intimidate voters, and terrorize neighborhoods in support ofa candidate or party. Clandestine negotiations and agreements between government officials and gangs cccur as well, Dr, Boerman opines that the:police cannot control the gangs in El Selvador becouse the necessary infrastructure does not exiit, The country has been ravaged by gang members, but at the same time the police and government are hyper-vigilant about gang presence, and violence is an integral pert of policing and law enforcement, ‘The police stop anyone they do not know, ee 2 This fear rising from being labeled as ape member inthe U.S. was not inched in respondents nial asylums application led with the court on Deceinbéf1, 2017. Exh. 3. > DHS did not challenge Dr. Boerman's qualification as an expert witness. particularly young to middle-aged mea, to threats or abuses, trip the individual to search for tattoos, and subject him According to Dr. Boerman, prbtocols exist between the U.S, and Salvadoran governments, such that the U.S. government alerts the Salvadoran government when a criminal deportee is returned to that country. Ifa criminal deportee returns to their former neighborhood, the residents become aware of the reftrn. If the deportee relocates to a new area, residents inquire about them. If an actual or su§pected gang member arrives in a certain area, the police will know of his presence, Ifa deportee is labeled as gonf affiliated by the U.S. government, for example if designaied as such on an I-213 form or through the U.S. embassy, that individual is subject to additional scrutiny at customs. cessing at the airport, and immigration and security forces may be involved. Dr. Boerman believes this is an “entirely appropriate” interview, which may become an interrogation, ‘The deportdeis questioned about gang affiliation and which items they ae bringing from the U.S. The individual is also fingerprinted and photographed. Once an individual gets past this legal dimensibin, the door is opened to extra-judicial problems. Dr. Boerman is familiar with several dozen incidents involving such problems. Dr. Boerman described Decree 717, a provision of Salvadoran law that requires returned Salvadorans labeled as members or collaborators of gangs or other illicit groups to register with the government, and provide their address. See Exh. 4, tab F, An individual can be taken into longterm custody for failing or refusing to comply. Dr. Boerman was not aware of exactly how an individual complies with the registration requirement; whether the deportee must go to @ police substation or to a parole-type office. Dr, Boerman believes that Salvadoran immigration authorities would initiate this process'and input the deportee’s information into a government computer system, such that the police'and military would be aware of the information. No protocol exists to purge gang membership from a government database, and if officers on the street believe that an individual is a gang member, the purging of that person's name from a database would not change that belief’ Gang members cannot function without a political agenda, They shape the sociopolitical climate through the use of terror and manipulation of the political system to gain relative assurances of their ability to operate. :They negotiate with political and police officials to establish the parameters of each paryis allowable actions. It is impossible to distinguish criminality trom polities, Dr. Boerman reviewed respondents written file, including the I-213, and spoke to respondent's counsel. He did not interview respondent himself. Dr. Boerman concludes that respondent’ life is at risk in E] Salvador because he was identified as a gang member in the U. Between 2014-2018 or so, the Salvadoran government reported almost 2,000 confrontations between gang members and the police. Approximately 1500 gang members were killed in the last several years, but this number dogs not include beatings, torture, and disappearances. The police do make reports regarding these incidents, but they are not investigated, Forensic teams remove the body and take it to # morgtie, but the number of killings that occur but are not reported is unknown, Longterm residents of the US are generally not seen as residents of El Salvador anymore, If respondent refuitns there and engages in activities a gang sees as a challenge, for example religious prostlytizing, that would put R in greater danger because he 4 would be seen as a stranger getting involved in gang activity.‘ ‘The Salvadoran government leaves individuals alone to deal with these problems, ‘The ability to relocate internally is a fallacy, as El Salvador is a small couiftry and the population is hypervigitant about who is present in the social environment, People are posted at the entrance to neighborhoods who monitor the ingress of every individual. If they encounter a stranger, they call a designated point of contact and then stop the entering individual to look for tattoos, and rob him of state- issued identity documents. ‘They then investigate the individual's identity, including from whence be hhas come. According to Dr. Boerman, the main concerns for respondent are the Salvadoran military and police, Gang members ate a secondary concern. An anti-gang political opinion ‘would endangers respondent only if he expressed that in a visible way. There are gated communities th El Salvador where respondent could live safely, but that lifestyle would require significant fitiancial resources. Respondent is unlikely to have access to such funds, Without them, he will likely live in a lower income area that is gang affected or gang controlled, A ‘On cross-examination, Dr. Boerman acknowledged that residents who “keep their heads down” and comply with extortion demands can be safe, but a person who is “on the gang’s radar” for whatever reason is exposed to particulatized risk. Dr. Boerman does not know how ‘many known or suspected gang members are ceported back to El Salvador every year, He was not aware if the U.S, government shafes the form I-213 itself with the Salvadoran government, rather than just the information on the document. There are two different information sharing protocols, but Dr. Boerman was not aware if there exists another particular document that would be shared. There are no statistis regarding the number of individual imprisoned for suspected gang membership who are tortured: but abuses are rampant, widespread and occur with impunity, 400-600 police officers are arrested for abuses every year, and the majority go back to work without charge, It would be impossible to conduct a study regarding how many individuals who like respondent returned to El Salvador after being identified as a gang member, were tortured or killed, such that no such statistics exist, C. Legal Standards i Asylum To be statutorily eligible for asylum, an applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is a refugee, which requires a showing of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(b)(I)(A); 8 CPLR. §§ 1208.13, 1240.8(4), If cligibility is determined, asylum may be granted in the exercise of disoretion. INA § 208(b)(1)(A}; INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987). * Respondent indicates that he is regular churchgoer inthe U.S., but did not assert religion as a basis for his ol ‘the most recent version of his asylum application. Exh 6, p. 5. 9 8. Credibility and Corroboration 2 In all applications for asylurs; the court must make a threshold determination of the applicant's credibility. Matter of O-Ds, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). Under the REAL ID Act, after considering “the totality,pf the evidence, and all relevant factors,” the court may base a credibility determination on: the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant; the inherent plausibility of the account; J the consistency between oral and written statements; the internal consistency of such statements; the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record; and any inaccuracy or falsehood in such statements, “without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falschood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim, or any other relevant factor.” INA § 208(b)(1)(B)\\(iii); see also Diallo v. U.S. Dep’ of Justice, 548 F.3d 232, 234 n.1 (2d Cir, 2008); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 1&N Dee. 260, 266 (BIA 2007). In addition, an applicant requesting asylum under INA § 208 bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion, Testimony that is credible, persuasive, and “refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee” may be sufficient to meet this burden of proof absent corroboration, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); see also 8 C.F.R, § 1208,13(a). However, Where the Immigration Judge determines that “the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony,"
,"such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannit reasonably obtain the evidence.” INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). ‘The court should provide an applicant who has not submitted reasonably available corroborating evidence, both an opportunity to explain the absence of such evidence and a continuance if he demonstrates good cause, Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 519 (BIA 2015). b. Statutory Eligibility ‘An asylum applicant may demonstrate that he is a “refugee” in either of two ways. First, he may demonstrate that he suffered:past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, ‘membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, INA §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(6(1)(A); 8 CPR. § 1208.13(b)(1). Second, he may demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution ‘on account of a protected ground by demonstrating that he subjectively fears persecution and that, his fear is objectively reasonable. INA § 101(a\\(42)(A); Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). ©. Past Persecution To establish past persecution; an asylum applicant must demonstrate that he suffered persecution in his country of nationality or, if stateless, in his country of last habitual residence, con account of a protected ground, and that he is unable or unwilling to return to, or avail himself of the protection of, that country’ because of such persecution. INA §§ 101(a)(42(A), 208(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1208,13(b)¢1). “Persecution” has generally been interpreted to include threats to life or freedom. Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec, 211, 222 (BIA 1985). “[It] is the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground,” and includes “non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse.” [vanishvili vy, U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To constitute persecution, threats typically must be “imminent,” “concrete,” or “so menacing as to 10 cause significant actual suffering or harm.” Ci Pan v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 449 F.3d 408, 412 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Guan Sham Liao v. U.S, Dep't of Justice, 293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 2002). Moreover, persecution must be inflicted by eithép the government or by a person or entity the government is. \\g or unable to control.” Maiter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. at 222; see also Pavlova v, LN.S., 441 F.3d 82, 91 2d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). In Martor of A-B-, though the Attorney General did not negate the possibility {hat violence inflicted by non-governmental actors may serve. as the basis for an asylum or withholding application based on membership in a particular social ‘group, he stated that outside “exceptional circumstances” such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address. 27 1&N Dec. 316, 317 (A.G: 2018). d. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution If past persecution is established, a regulatory presumption arises that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of his original claim. 8 C.P.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). ‘The Department may rebut this presumption if it demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant’s fear is no longer well-founded due to a fundamental change in circumstances or because the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that it would be reasonable to expeet him to do so. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)-Gi). e. Discretion . ‘An applicant who establishes statutory eligibility for asylum still bears the burden of demonstrating that he merits @ grant of asylum as a matter of discretion. INA § 208(b)(1)(A); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 428 1, 5 (noting that the Attorney General is not required to grant asylum fo everyone who meets the’ refugee definition). In determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, both favorable and adverse factors should be considered. ‘Mater of Pula, 19 [&N Dec. 467, 473-74 (BIA 1987) (superseded by regulation on other grounds). General humanitarian factors, such a age, health, or family ties, should also be considered in the exercise of discretion, Matter of H-, 24 1&N Dec. at 347-48; Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. at 474. In the absence of any adverse factors, asylum should be granted, Jd. at 474, In addition, the danger of persecution should outweigh all but the most egregious adverse factors. Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, 436 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir. 2006), IV, ANALYSIS A, Asylum-Timeliness Under INA § 208(a)(2)(B), itis the respondent's burden to show by clear and convineing evidence that he applied for asylum within one year of his last arrival in the U.S. Here, respondent claims to have entered the U.S. in oF about April 2006, and the asylum application was filed on December 1, 2017, after respondent was taken into DHS custody. Therefore, the application was admittedly untimely filed by over ten years. However, even if a respondent does not file within cone year of entry, he may still pursue an application for asylum if she shows either changed or extraordinary circumstances. INA‘§ 208(a)(2)D). An application must be filed within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the changed or extraordinary circumstances. Here, tespondent alleges that he filed his application within a reasonable time after he became aware that he had been labeled a gang member: by U.S. authorities. Respondent also learned while he was detained that a cousin of his, who had joined a gang, was killed shortly after he was deported to El Salvador from the U.S. : The latter reason is not sufficignt to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances, as respondent does not indicate when his. cousin was deported, or any details surrounding the killing, such as where and why it may have occurred, or the identity of the perpetrators. It is lacking in the details necessary to establish exactly how it relates to respondent’s asylum application. However, respondent becoming award that DHS had labeled him # gang member constitutes such a circumstance, as it created a new basis for him to fear persecution should he return to El Salvedor. Further, respondent filed within a reasonable period of time, less than four months, after learning that he had been labelled a gang meniber by DHS. Accordingly, he has met an exception to the. one-year filing deadline and his application for asylum will be considered on the merits, B, Credibility and Corrobordition ‘The parties stipulated that respondent filed a credible claim, ‘The court finds that Dr Boerman testified credibly. His testimony, as a whole, was specific, internally consistent, and consistent with his written statement and other documentary evidence. See INA § 208(b)(1\\(B\\Gii); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 &N Dee. at 266; Diallo, $48 F.3d at 234 n. 1, DHs made no specific challenge to his credibility either. C. Statutory Eligibility i Past Persecution Respondent did not establish that he suffered past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, To establish persecution on account of political opinion, the applicant must, demonstrate through direct or circumstantial evidence that the persecution is “on account of the vietim's political opinion, not the persecutor’s.” See INS v. Blias-Zacarias, $02 U.S. 478, 482 (1992) (emphasis in original); see also Castro v. Holder, 597 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir, 2010). ‘The Second Cireuit has explained that a political opinion does not necessarily mean the expression of an allegiance to a particular political group. Osorio v. LN.S., 18 F.3d 1017, 1030 (2d Cir. 1994). ‘An imputed political opinion can constitute a ground of persecution whether correctly or incorrectly attributed. See Vumi v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 150, 156 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Castro, 597 F.3d at 100. He contends that he was persecuted on account of his anti-gang political opinion, which he manifested by refusing to join the gang. Respondent, however, does not indicate that he expressed an anti-gang political opinion to them, other being unwilling to join them or be extorted by them, Exh. 4;tab A. He also did not establish that the gang imputed any opinion to him, other than his unwillingness to be recruited or subjected to the crime of extortion. ii, Well-Founded Fea.of Future Persecution As respondent did not establish past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, he does not benefit from: a: regulatory presumption of @ well-founded fear of future persecution and therefore continues’to bear the burden of proof, See 8 C.E.R. § 1208.13(b)(1) ‘The court finds that respondent met:that burden. 12 Respondent argues that he has an objectively well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a partjgular social group defined as “U.S. law enforcement labeled gang members.” The BIA has interprbted “particular social group” to mean a group with members who “share a common, immutable characteristic” that members cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences, See Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dee. 211, 233 (BIA 1985); Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 365 66 (BIA 1996). Social groups must be classes recognizable by society at large, Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 336 (AG 2018). Moreover, the purported group must also exhibit a shared characteristic that is socially distinct’ within the society in questiah and defined with sufficient particularity.© Matter of M-E- V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014); Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208, 210-12 (BIA 2014); Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d 191, 196 (2d Cir. 2014), When assessing the particularity and social distinction of a putative social group, defining characteristics must be assessed in the social and cultural context of the applicant's country of citizenship or nationality. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee. at 241; see also W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dee. at 214-15. ‘The BIA held that the “particularity” requirement relates to the group’s boundaries or, as, carlier court decisions described it, the need to put ‘outer limits” on the definition of a ‘particular social group.\""” M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238, While neither cohesiveness nor homogeneity among group members is required, see Koudriachova v. Gonzales, 490 F.3d 255, 263 (2d Cir. 2007), particular social groups must be defined by conerete characteristies that provide a “clear benchmark for determining who falls-within the group,” and who does not. M-E-V-G-, 26 L&N Dec. at 239. “It is critical that the terms used to describe the group have commonly accepted the society of which the group is a part,” Jd, at 238, Particularity ensures that the group is “disorete” with “definable boundaries” such that itis not “amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective.” 1d. see also Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. at 335 (noting that social groups defined by their vulnerability to private criminal activity likely lack particularity, given that broad swaths of society may be susceptible to victimization). Respondent met his burden’6f establishing a well-founded fear of persecution on account ofa statutorily protected ground, his friembership in a particular social group. Respondent’s social group, “U.S, law enforcement labeled gang members” is cognizable, in that its members share an immutable characteristic that is socially distinct within Salvadoran society and defined with sufficient particularity. This characteristic is immotable, in that, according to Dr. Boerman, once an individual is labeled as a gang member in police records in El Salvador, there is no means by which to purge that identification from national databases, or from the awareness of local police renamed the “social visibility\"" requirement “social distinction” to clarify that it does not refer tothe literal visibility of @ social group.

Reiser v. Gao, $52 US. 801 (2007) 13 officers, The group is socially distinct; in that its members are compelled by Decree 717 to register and regularly report to the government, and the existence of the decree itself demonstrates a governmental and societal view of suspected gang-afliliated deportees fiom the U.S. to be especially suspect and warranting goyéinmental surveillance, ‘There is also sufficient evidence to suggest that respondent is a member‘ of this group, as the record established that the U.S. and Salvadoran governments participatesin two information sharing protocols, which apply to both criminal and immigration removal ifvestigetion records. Exh, 4, tab Z, p. 231. There is no evidence to suggest that respondent's 1-213, which identifies him as a gang member, will not automatically be shared with the Salvadoran government. While DHS counsel indicated that according to his own investigation, pefsonnel from ICE in New York do not share such information with Salvadoran authorities, counsel's statements camnot be construed as testimony or evidence. Further, those statements do not obviate the possibility that there may be additional documents in respondent's A file from the Suffolk: County Sheriff's Department that label respondent as a gang member Further, respondent’s fear is subjectively reasonable, considering that he was previously stabbed by a gang member and currently has an additional reason to feat their renewed interest, as he has been labeled an MS-13 gang shember by the U.S. government, which may cause him to be targeted by rival gangs in addition to'Baramilitary forces or the Salvadoran police. His fear is also objectively reasonable, as the recordjevidence, specifically Dr. Boerman’s written statement and testimony indicate that the Salvadoratgovernment will have access to respondent's [-213, which identifies him as an MS-13 member,” Dr. Boerman described several dozen incidents in wiich deportces identified as criminals, fetumed to El Salvador, were stopped and identified by Salvadoran authorities upon entty, atid then faced extra-judicial problems. The Salvadoran police and gangs have a violent, if at other times, symbiotic relationship with gangs, and respondent is, likely to be targeted as a gang member once he is identified upon entry into the country as @ labeled ‘gang member, Respondent also faces targeting by extra-judicial groups, which are often composed of police officers. Gang members are disproportionately killed during confrontations with members of the police, and E Salvadot’s Vice-President indicated in 2017 that police officers had the right to use deadly force against garg members “without any fear of suffering consequences.” Exh. 4 tab H, p. 110, tab J, p. 122. “According to the U.S. State Department 20/7 El Salvador Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the most significant human rights issues included alleged unlawful killings of suspected gang members and others by security forces; forced disappearances by military personnel, which the government prosecuted; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening. prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of government respect for judicial impartiality and independence and widespread government corruption, Impunity persisted despite government steps to dismiss and prosecute some officials in the security forces, the executive branch, and the justice system who committed abuses.’ In many neighborhoods, armed groups and gangs targeted certain persons, interfered with privacy, family, and home life, and created a climate of fear. Efforts by authorities to remedy these situations were generally ineffective. The major gangs controlled their own territory. Gang ‘members did not allow persons living in another gang’s controlled area to enter their territory, ‘even when travelling via public transportation. Gangs forced persons to present identification cards, The court takes administrative notice of the most recent State Department report, as it was not filed by ether party Yang v. MoElroy, 277 F.3d 158 (2d. Cir. 2002). 4 (containing their addresses) to determiite their residence. If gang members discovered that a person lived in a rival gang’s territory, that person risked being killed, beaten, or not allowed to enter the territory. 3 In sum, the testimonial and documentary record demonstrates that respondent has an objectively well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of both state and non-state actors in El Salvador on account of his membership in a particular social group. Cf: Scarlett v, Barr, ~-F.3d--, 2020 WL 2046544 (2d Cir. Apr. 28, 2020). Respondent’s status as a U.S, labelled gang member will render him subject to the requirements of Decree 717, which in turn will make him a target for Salvadoran police, extra-judicial forces and by rival gangs. This demonstrates a nexus between his feared harm and his meitbership in his social group. Accordingly, respondent has demonstrated his statutory eligibility for asylum, iii, Discretion : The court finds that respondent warrants a favorable exercise of discretion, While DHS has labeled respondent a gang member in the U,S., no evidence was provided to establish that respondent is or was in fact so affiliated, Further, despite having resided in the U.S. for many years, hhe has no criminal record, Although respondent entered the U.S. illegally and has remained here for over a decade, these actions are insufficient to deny his asylum application in the exercise of discretion. See Wu Zheng Huang, 436 F.3d at 99; see also Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dee. at 473-74 (Discretionary denial should not be based solely on the respondent’s matter of entry into the United States.”) ‘Thus, when considering the totality of the circumstances, a grant of the application is warranted, 1d, Accordingly, the court grants the respondent’ application for asylum. 3 V. CONCLUSION ‘The respondent established that he is statutorily eligible for asylum and that he merits a favorable exercise of discretion under INA § 208, Accordingly, after a careful review of the record, the following order will be entered: Accordingly, after careful review of the record, the following orders will be entered: § As the court has granted the’ respéndent’s application for asylum pursuant to INA § 208, the remainder of arguments and his applications for withholding of removal under INA §281(bX3) and under CAT will ot be reached inthis decision. 8 CFR. §1208.16(0), 15 ORDER S HEREBY ORDERED that the respondent's application for asylum under INA § 208 be GRANTED, & Date: _6/15/20.

DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION COURT URAL HISTORY The Respondents are a thirty-six-year-old woman, and her son, aged eleven. Both are natives and citizens of El Salvador, ‘The Respondent is alleged to have entered the United States at Hidalgo, Texas on August 9, 2015, at which time she Consequently, the e was not admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer.

Form I-867A, Record of Sworn Statement of Proceedings under section 235(b)(1) of the Act. Il. STANDARDS OF LAW A. Cre ity In all applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Act, the Court must, make a threshold determination of the alien’s credibility. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079 (BIA 1998); Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 1987). ‘The provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005 apply to the Court's credibility analysis in asylum applications filed on or after May 11, 2005. Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (2005), codified at section 208(b)(1)(B)(ili) of the Act. Considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Cour{ may base a credibility determination on: the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant’s or witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant’s or witness’s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the intemal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other relevant factor, REAL ID Act § 101(d)(2); INA § 208(b\\(1(BY{ii) (2017). Accordingly, inconsistencies between statements in an asylum application and testimony during the asylum proceedings may lead to a finding that the applicant is not credible, Phat v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 85, 89 (Ist Cir, 2008). An applicant's testimony alone will only be sufficient to sustain her burden of proving eligibility for asylum without corroboration if the Court is satisfied that the testimony is eredible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a) (2017); see Guta-Tolossa v, Holder, 674 F.3d 57, 62 (Ist Cir, 2012). Credibility determinations must be “reasonable” and “take into consideration the individual circumstances of the applicant.” Lin v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 22, 28 n.3 (Ist Cir. 2008). ‘The Court must provide “specific and cogent reasons why an inconsistency, or a series of inconsistencies, renders the alien’s testimony not credible.” Jabri v. Holder, 675 F.3d 20, 24 (Ist Cir. 2012) (quoting Kartasheva v, Holder, $82 F.3d 96, 105 (1st Cir. 2009)), Unreasonable demands are not placed on an applicant to present evidence to corroborate particular experiences. Soeung v. Holder, 677 F.3d 484, 488 (1st Cir. 2012). However, where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts, such evidence should be provided. Id, at 487-88; see INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). If such evidence is unavailable, the applicant must explain its unavailability, and the Court must ensure that the applicant’s explanation is cluded in the record. Soeung, 677 F.3d at 488, The absence of such corroboration can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof. /d.; Guta-Tolossa, 674 F.3d at 62 ({A]n IJ can require corroboration whether or not she makes an explicit credibility finding”); see Matter of S-M-J-, 21 1&N Dec. 722, 725 (BIA 1997). B. Asylum The Court may grant asylum to an alien who timely files an application and meets the definition of a refugee. INA § 208(b)(1)(A). An alien is a “refugee” within the meaning of INA § 101(2)(42)(A) if she is unwilling or unable to return to her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ‘The applicant bears the burden of establishing that she is a refugee within the meaning of INA § 101 (a)(42)(A) and that she merits a favorable exercise of discretion. 8 CF.R. § 1208.13(a); INS v, Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987). 1. Persecution Persecution is “a threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering gr harm upon, those who differ in a way regarded as offensive.” Matter of Acosta, 19 18N Dec. 2]1, 222 (BIA 1985), overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439 |(BIA 1987) Persecution does not encompass general conditions of violence shared by many others in a country or the harm an individual may experience as a result of civil strife. Tay-Chan y, Holder, 699 F.3d 107, 112-13 (Ist Cir. 2012). Rather, to qualify as persecution, a person’s experience must “rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering” and consist of systemic mistreatment rather than a series of isolated events. Rebenko v. Holder, 693 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (Ist Cir. 2000)). The “severity, duration, and frequency of physical abuse” are relevant factors to this determination. Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 133 (Ist Cir, 2005); Vasili v. Holder, 732 F.3d 83, 89 (Ist Cir. 2013) (“Infrequent beatings, threats, or periodic detention . . . do not rise to the level of persecution, and the nature and extent of an applicant’s injuries are relevant to the ultimate determination”). “[C]redible, specific threats can amount to persecution if they are severe enough . . . Threats of murder fit squarely within this rubric.” Javed v. Holder, 715 F.3d 391, 395-96 (Ist Cir. 2013) (internal quotation omitted). Physical violence is not required for a finding of past persecution, but “makes a threat more likely to constitute persecution,” id. at 396, but “threats standing alone constitute past persecution in only ‘a small category of cases, and only when the threats are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.” Bonilla v. Mukasey, 539 F.3d 72, 77 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal citation omitted). An applicant who has suffered past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of that same protected ground, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b\\1). This presumption may only be rebutted if DHS establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a “fundamental change in circumstances” in the country at issue, such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution, 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). 2, Basis and Nexus ‘The applicant must establish that a statutorily-protected ground — race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion — is “at least one central reason” for the applicant's persecution. INA §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(b)(i); Sugiarto v. Holder, $86 F.3d 90, 95 (Ist Cir. 2009); Matter of J-B-N- d& S-M-, 24 1&N Dec. 208, 212-15 (BIA 2007). Persecution on account of the statutorily protected grounds refers to persecution motivated by the vietim’s traits, not the persecutor’s. INS v, Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 482 (1992). While the applicant need not identify the persecutors with certainty or prove that the alleged persecutors targeted her solely because of a protected characteristic, the applicant must provide some evidence, direct or circumstantial, to establish “that the persecution was based, ‘at least in part,’ on an impermissible motivation.” Ivanov v. Holder, 736 F.3d 5, 12 (Ist Cir. 2013) (quoting Sompotan v, Mukasey, 333 F.3d 63, 69 (Ist Cir. 2008)); J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dee. at 216-217. An applicant for asylum or withholding of removal seeking relief based on their political opinion must show more than “mere opposition” to gangs or refusal to join a gang is insufficient to constitute a political opinion. INS v, Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 482 (1992); see also Alvizures-Gomes v, Lynch, 830 F.3d 49, 52-53 (Ist Cir. 2016) (finding that refusal to join a gang is not an expression of a political opinion, and that no nexus had been established because gangs “may have a nearly infinite variety of reasons for targeting a particular individual, including greed or an aspiration to increase their membership” and thus “mere refusal to join a gang, without more, does not compel a conclusion that the alleged persecutor viewed the alien’s resistance as an expression of a political opinion”) (intemal citations omitted); Mayorga-Vidal v. Holder, 675 F.3d 9, 18 (Ist Cir. 2012) (holding that “mere refusal to join” a gang does not constitute “an expression of an anti-gang, pro-establishment political opinion”) (internal citation omitted); Mendez-Barrera v, Holder, 602 F.3d 21, 27 (Ist Cir. 2010) (holding that “particular religious or political beliefs, without more, is not sufficient to show persecution on account of those beliefs. ... There must be evidence that the would-be persecutors knew of the beliefs and targeted the belief holder for that reason”) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in original). In order to prevail on a claim based on political opinion, there “must be evidence that the gang knew of [the applicant's) political opinion and targeted [the applicant] because of it.” Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. Att'y Gen. of US., 663 F.3d 582, 609 (Ist Cir. 2011). Where the applicant started a prayer group, “helped people in social projects,” and claimed to be vocally opposed to criminal enterprises, the First Circuit affirmed the denial of her applications for relief and held that “mere opposition to crime, without more, does not constitute a political opinion.” Giraldo-Pabon v, Lynch, 840 F.3d 21, 25 (Ist Cir. 2016). An applicant for asylum or withholding of removal seeking relief based on “membership in a particular social group” must establish that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinet within the society in question. Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208, 221 (BIA 2014). See also Matter of A-B>, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 319 (A.G. 2018). Family has been recognized as a cognizable social group for purposes of withholding of removal. See, e.g., Aldana-Ramos v. Holder, 757 F.3d 9, 15 (Ist Cir. 2014) (“[A] family may be a particular social group simply by virtue of its kinship ties, without requiring more”); Perlera-Sola v. Holder, 699 F.3d 572, 576 (1st Cir. 2012) (a family is a particular social group only where “the motivation for persecution is kinship\""); Gebremichael v. INS, 10 F.3d 28, 36 (Ist Cir. 1993) (“There can ... be no plainer example of a social group based on common, identifiable, and immutable characteristics than that of the nuclear family\""). See also 5 Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1, & N. Dec. 208, 212-18 (BIA 2014) (a particular social group is cognizable when it is (1) comprised of members who share a common immutable or fundamental characteristic; (2) socially distinct within the society in question; and (3) defined with particulatity); see also Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I. & N. Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014), For family membership to be a cognizable particular social group, the family must be cognizable to society, and not simply cognizable only to the persecutor. Matter of L-E-A-, 27 1&N Dec. 581, 586 (A.G. 2019); see also Pena Oseguera v. Barr, F.3d_, No. 17-60339; 2019 WL 3980184 at *2 (Sth Cir. 2019) (holding that “Matter of L-E-A- stands for the proposition that families may qualify as social groups, but the decision must be reached on a case-by-case basis.”) With respect to gang activity, “[a] national community may struggle with significant societal problems resulting from gangs, but not all societal problems are bases for asylum.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 251. Specifically, “although certain segments of a population may bbe more susceptible to one type of criminal [gang] activity than another, the residents all generally suffer from the gang’s criminal efforts to sustain its enterprise in the area.” Id. at 250-251. Thus, an asylum applicant basing his or her claim on a factual scenario involving gangs must establish membership in a cognizable particular social group and prove that he or she has been targeted on that basis. See id. at 250 ~ 251; Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 579, 587 — 588 (BIA 2008). While the applicant need not identify the persecutors with certainty or prove that the alleged persecutors targeted him or her solely because of a protected characteristic, the applicant must provide some evidence, direct or circumstantial, to establish “that the persecution was based, ‘at least in part,’ on an impermissible motivation,” Ivanov v, Holder, 736 F.3d 5, 12 (Ist Cir. 2013) (quoting Sompotan v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 63, 69 (Ist Cir. 2008); see also Matter of J-B-N- & S- M-, supra at 215 — 217. But see Matter of A-B-, 27 18N Dec. at 338-339 (“When private actors inflict violence based on a personal relationship with a victim, then the victim's membership in a larger group may well not be “one central reason” for the abuse”). Where a petitioner presents “no evidence other than his own speculation” to forge the statutorily required “link,” no nexus is established. Guerra-Marchorro v. Holder, 760 F.3d 126, 129 (Ist Cir. 2014) (quoting Khalil v. Ashcrofi, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (Ist Cir, 2003)); see also Sugiarto, supra 95 —96 (no nexus where record contained no evidence supporting petitioner's stated belief she was targeted because of her religion). 3. Government Action ‘The persecution that the applicant experienced or fears must be the ditect result of government action, government-supported action, or the government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct. Ivanov, 736 F.3d at 12 (quoting Sok v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 48, 54 (Ist Cir, 2008)). “Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are not, controllable by the government.” Da Silva v, Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 7 (Ist Cir. 2005), To establish that the government is unable to control a private actor, an applicant “must show more than difficulty . . . controlling private behavior.” A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Menjivar v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted)). ‘That “local police have not acted on a particular report of an individual crime does not necessarily mean that the government is unwilling or unable to control crime,” and a showing that the crime has gone unpunished is insufficient to show that the government is unwilling or unable to prevent it. Id. at 337-38. 4, Discretion An applicant for asylum has the burden of establishing that a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, INA § 208(b)(1)(B); Pula, 19 I&N Dec. at 473-74 (superseded by regulation on other grounds); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.14(a). In exercising discretion, the Court must examine the totality of the circumstances. Pula, 19 I&N Dee. at 473-74, C, Withholding of Removal Pursuant to INA Section 241(b)(3) Section 241(b)(3) of the Act is a non-discretionary provision requiring the Court to withhold removal of an individual upon proof that her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, ‘or membership in a particular social group. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish either (1) that she has experienced past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) that it is “more likely than not” that her life or freedom would be threatened in the future on account of a protected ground. 8 CFR. § 1208.16(b)(1)-(2) D. Protection Under the Convention Against Torture Under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as implemented by 8 C.F-R §§ 1208.16-1208.18, an applicant is eligible for withholding of removal if she establishes that it is “more likely than not” that she would be tortured in the proposed country of removal by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 8 C.F.R §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1); see also Convention Against Torture, art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, S, Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988). “Torture” is defined, in part, as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). IV. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW ‘The Court has considered all admitted evidence and testimony in its entirety, even if not specifically mentioned further in the text of this decision. A. Credibility ‘The Court finds the Respondent to have testified credibly, notwithstanding certain inconsistencies between her testimony and other evidence of record. For one, the transcript from the Respondent's interview with an immigration officer indicates that she said that she came to the United States to work and that she had no fear of returning to El Salvador. However, before the Court, she denied telling the officer that she came to the United States to work and that she did not fear being persecuted or tortured. Exh. 11. When asked to explain this inconsistency, she maintained that she told the officer she feared returning to El Salvador. In another, the Respondent testified that she did not plan to leave El Salvador, for the United States or otherwise, prior to July 2015. However, she later testified that prior to July 2015, she had planned to go to Guatemala with the other members of the directiva, the town council, but cancelled those plans when she was informed that she would have to get her husband’s consent to bring? The Respondent's explanation that her plans changed and that she no longer planned to leave El Salvador was persuasive and credible. Although the Court found the Respondent's testimony that, despite the fact that her husband {J and her son {NII were in the United States, she had no plans to come to the United States to reunite with her family implausible, it is not inherently so and is not held against her. The Respondent's testimony was otherwise consistent with her application and the other evidence of record. It was detailed and plausible in light of country conditions. She did not appear to embellish her account, and even admitted information that was not helpful to her claim. For example, she admitted that other members of the directiva were not targeted to the extent that she was, despite engaging in the same type of work. The Respondent’s claim was also corroborated, including a medical report finding that an exam of her left shoulder was consistent with her report of “having fractured her clavicle and having her shoulder anteriorly dislocated twice.” Exh. 7 at 706. B. Asylum pursuant to INA § 208 ‘The Respondent's application was timely filed within one year of her arrival in the United States. Her claim is based on her religion, political opinion, imputed membership in the particular social group of informants against gangs in El Salvador, and actual membership in two social groups, articulated as: (1) her family, and (2) women living in El Salvador without male protection. ‘The Court finds that the Respondent has established that she suffered past persecution on account of her political opinion and her family membership? 1, Harm Rising to the Level of Persecution The Respondent suffered harm rising to the level of persecution, which included increasing levels of violence and threats against her life. These occurred when the Respondent attended the soccer matches that she organized and in her home. On one oceasion, gang members shot firearms at the soccer field during a match that she attended. Exh. 7 at 671. In 2013, after the Respondent was elected to a formal position within the directiva, an MS-13 gang member broke into the Respondent’s home, stripped off his clothes and took a bath.” Jd, at 681. When MS-13 learned that the Respondent was working with the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID*) to build 2 community center, gang members complained that the Respondent was keeping the neighborhood children away from the gangs. They told the president of the directiva that they knew about the well in the Respondent's backyard and said that it would be her “and 's tomb.” Jd. at 681. The threats resulted in actual suffering. The Respondent continues to “symptoms of mental distress consistent with someone who has survived significant traumatic experiences.” Exh, 7 at 706. These symptoms “meet diagnostic criteria for post- 2-The Respondent's husband! was li 1g in the United States atthe time, > The Court does net reach the Respondent’s alternative claims, 8 traumatic stress disorder.” Jd. Following the opening of the center in 2015, gang members smashed the windows and vandalized the building. Id. at 682. Also in 2015, the Respondent was attacked by members of a rival gang, Barrio 18. Soon after, in an attack ordered by an MS-13 member, her arm was “yanked” “so hard that it came out of the socket again.” The Respondent was badly injured enough to return to the hospital. It took three people to set her arm back in its socket. Id. at 683; see also id. at 692, In another attack, her son {EIN s dog was poisoned by MS-13 to send a message and to ensure that the dog could not warn her if they were breaking in again. Id, at 683. The Respondent continues to experience pain in her left shoulder. Her shoulder locks and clicks, Exh, 7 at 703. The Court takes into account in the aggregate the aforementioned threats and acts of violence, and notes their increasingly violent nature. The Respondent suffered repeated and personalized threats against her life and the lives of her children. Gang members demonstrated the credibility of those threats by breaking into the Respondent's home on at least two occasions = on one occasion stripping naked, and on another killing the family pet. ‘These threats were combined with confrontations and physically attacking her such that she continues to suffer. These increasingly violent threats and attacks are more than a “series of somewhat vague verbal threats.” Abdelmaiek, 540 F.3d at 23, Further, the harm and fear suffered because of this persecution are not negated simply because there is general violence by the gangs and disorder in El Salvador. Ordonez-Quino v. Holder, 760 F.3d 80, 88-90 (Ist Cir. 2014) (explaining that a group can be intentionally targeted during a war); see also Matter of H-, 21 I&N Dec. 337, 343 (BIA 1996) (finding that persecution “can and often does take place in the context of civil war”) (internal citation omitted). 2. Basis and Nexus a. Political Opinion One central reason that the Respondent was persecuted was on account of her political opinion. She has shown more than “a generalized ‘political’ motive” underlying the persecution, Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 482; see also Alvizures-Gomes, 830 F.3d at 52-53. Here, the Respondent not only opposed the gangs, she affirmatively sought to disrupt their recruitment of children. To further these ideals, the Respondent worked as a community activist and organizer in El Salvador through the directiva, the town council of elected representatives, of which she was a member. She organized soccer tournaments and “the Day of the Child.” She also worked with USAID to build a community center in order to keep children involved in activities and away from the gangs. The gang members were aware of her views and activities, and targeted her because of them. Upon her election to the position of “vocal, someone who serves as a voice for the community” within the directiva, gang members began harassing the Respondent “wherever [she] went.” Exh. 7 at 678. These events go beyond “mere opposition to crime,” and constitute affirmative statements and actions b. Particular Social Group ‘The Respondent's family membership was another central reason for her persecution by the gang and, more specifically, her relationship to her sor SE, who witnessed 9 the MS-13 murder someone. They began to “more aggressively threaten {NJ because they thought he might have told the police about the murder he had witnessed.” Exh. 7 at 680. They then began threatening the Respondent “even more than they did before the murder,” told her to watch her children, called her a rat, and accused her and [I of reporting wha and HBB witnessed to police, 1d. The threats “never stopped for the rest of the time [she] was in El Salvador.” Jd. Even after the murderer was arrested, a gang member went to the Respondent's house, threatened her, demanded to see her phone to see if'she called police, and acctised of being “the rat who had informed on| the murderer. Id. After fled to the United States, gang members continued to harass the Respondent about “in the street, in the store, and everywhere [she] went.” Id, at 681, In July 2015, other gang members told the Respondent that “he knew tha had ratted them out to the police.” He demanded that she pay him S[ibr smuggle a (NAAM into the jail. Id. at 684. She refused and the gang member told her that the well in her backyard would become “a tomb for [the Respondent] and” /d. While {EM was targeted as an informant, a group that is generally not protected under the Act, the Respondent's family membership is a well-recognized, established, cognizable group.* Aldana-Ramos, 757 F.3d at 15. Here, however, the MS-13 targeted the Respondent and because of their familial relationship to EE. Their motive to harm the Respondent and because they are members of| family is not incidental, but is rather “one central reason” for the persecution she fears. 27 I&N Dec, at 46; Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 1&N Dec. 208 Gang members repeatedly threatened to kill the Respondent and broke into her home on at least two occasions, specifically because of her relationship to NJ. The Court finds that the Respondent established that MS-13 sought to harm the family members because of an animus against the family itself. The Respondent and J were well known in their community because the Respondent was an anti-gang activist, and she and {IJ were often see together. Thus the Respondent, [IN and their nuclear family were well-known and socially distinct within their community. Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I8N Dec, at $86, In Aldana-Ramos, gang members kidnapped the owner of a successful used car business, and extorted his sons for his return, 757 F.3d at 12-13. Even after the gang members murdered the business owner, they continued to pursue his sons, Jd, at 13. The fact that the gang members may have targeted the father only because of his wealth did not matter. J. at 18. What mattered in the sons’ case was the fact that they were targeted because of their familial relationship with their father, as they would not have been targeted if this protected characteristic did not exist. Id. at 16. In this case, even if the [IMINNMI was targeted because he witnessed 4 murder, the Respondent was persecuted on account of her membership in the particular social) group of her *Informants” are not suf ‘ently visible to constitute a cognizable particular social group for purposes of asylum or withholding of removal under the Act. See, e.g, Scatambuli v. Holder, $58 F.3d 53, 60 (Ist Cir. 2009) (rejecting “informants” as a particular social group because such a group failed to meet the social visibility requirement); Matter of C-A-,23, LN Dee. 951, 960 (BIA 2006) (rejecting “confidential informants” as a particular social group because members of such a group are 'gencrally out of the public view\"") The Court also notes that the Respondent's case is distinguishable from Marin-Portillo v. Lynch, 834 F.34 99 (Ist Ci 2016), to which the Board cited favorably in L-E-A-. In Morin-Portillo v. Lynch, the First Circuit held that “the ppersecutor, who was jailed for murdering the applicant's father, threatened the applicant and his family in order to retaliate or to deter them from seeking revenge against him, rather than because of their family membership.” L- 4-,27 1GN Dec. 40, 45 "
,"(A.G. 2017), overruled by Matter of -E-A-,27 1&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019) (explaining Marin- Portillo v. Lynch, 834 F.3d 99). 10 nuclear family. As in Aldana-Ramos, the gang members who attacked II would not have treated the Respondent the same way if the protected characteristic of her nuclear family membership did not exist. The Respondent’s membership in her nuclear family was “one central reason” for the persecution. Aldana-Ramos, 757 F.3d at 15, 18; Matter of J-B-N- & §-M-, 24 1&N Dec. at 214, Therefore, the Court finds that the Respondent met her burden of establishing that her nuclear family constituted a particular social group, and the nexus between that group and the persecution she suffered. 3. Government Action ‘The Respondent has established that the Salvadoran government is either unwilling or unable to protect her. Rosales Justo v. Sessions, 895 F.3d 154, 166 n.9 (Ist Cir. 2018) (an applicant can establish that the government of their home country is unable to protect her if she can “produce competent and sufficient evidence that the failures by the police ... went well beyond a government's failure to protect its citizens from all crime”) (internal citations omitted). There are high levels of corruption among the police in El Salvador, and, particularly in San Salvador and where the Respondent resided, they are unable to control organized crime. Rosales Justo, 895 F.3d at 159; see also Exh. 7 at 716 (noting “high levels of gang infiltration and overall corruption within the Salvadoran police and government” and that many “Salvadoran police officers in units across the country are complicit or actively engaged with gangs”), and at 1127 (noting that one of the principal human rights abuses in El Salvador was “esi corruption,” and that a “weak rule of law ... contributed to high levels of impunity and government abuse” despite attempts to “dismiss and prosecute” corrupt officials). Although the Salvadoran police arrested the individual who committed the murder witnessed by the Respondent's sons, this merely shows that “the police were willing to take on organized crime, not that the government is able to protect its citizens from organized crime.” Rosales Justo, 895 F.3d at 159. (RE the Respondent’s rural community, “is itself specifically known for gang violence.” Exh. 7 at 727. See also Exh, 7 at 324 (noting that in 2015, San Salvador was ranked “as one of the most violent cities in the world”), at 578, 580 (stating that San Salvador “is the world’s most homicidal city”); and at 726 (indicating that SEN is “considered one of the most violent [municipalities] in the country,” and that San Salvador has been called the “murder capital of the Americas”). Impunity, even for homicide, is the norm. See, ¢.g., Exh. 7 at 324, 578, 580, and 726. El Salvador has a long history of attempting to combat gang violence without success. See, e.g., Exh, 7 at 993 (“After fifteen years of failed security policies, the government of BI Salvador and criminal gangs are deadiocked in an open confrontation, Efforts aimed at tackling the deep- rooted social issues behind the gang phenomenon have not produced desired results due to a lack of political commitment and social divisions that gangs use to their advantage”). In many neighborhoods, gangs have “created a climate of fear that the authorities were not capable of restoring to normal.” Exh. 7 at 1139. While El Salvador has taken steps to combat gang violence, the results are limited to the point that a “senior government official said that authorities were fighting a war that cannot be won.” Exh. 7 at 1012 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Court notes that the failure to make a police report “is not necessarily fatal” to the Respondent’s claim if she can “demonstrate that reporting private abuse to government authori would have been futile.” Rosales Justo, 895 F.3d at 165 (quoting Morales-Morales v, i Sessions, 857 F.3d 130, 135 (Ist Cir, 2017)). Given the discussion of the documentary record above, the Court finds that it would have been futile for the Respondent to make a police report, and that her failure to do so does not impact the Court’s finding that the Salvadoran government is unable to protect her. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Having found that the Respondent suffered past persecution, she enjoys a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(bX1). This presumption may be rebutted if DHS establishes that there has been a “fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution” in the country at issue or that the applicant “could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part” of that country, Jd. § 1208.13(b)(1)()(A), (B). The Court finds that DHS has not rebutted this presumption by offering evidence under either prong of the regulation. 5. Discretion ‘There are no adverse discretionary factors in the record and the Respondent merits the favorable exercise of its discretion, 6. Derivative Asylum ‘The Respondent's son, |. co-Respondent, is included in her application and, as the Court grants the Respondent's application for asylum, the Court also grants derivative asylum to the co-Respondent. C. Withholding of Removal Pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) Because the Respondent has established her eligibility for asylum pursuant to INA § 208, the Court does not reach her application for withholding of removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3). D. Convention Against Torture Because the Respondent has established her eligibility for asylum pursuant to INA § 208, the Court does not reach her application for protection under the CAT. For the foregoing reasons, the Court enters the following orders: ORDERS IT IS ORDERED that the Respondents’ applications for Asylum, pursuant to INA § 208, be GRANTED. ‘The Respondents’ applications for withholding of removal under section 241 of the Act and for protection under the Convention Against Torture are NOT REACHED. If any party elects to appeal this decision, the Notice of Appeal must be received by the Board of Immigration Appeals within thirty (30) days of this decision. qfiela “Goole Date ROBIN E.

In her motion for change of venue, Respondent, through counsel admitted the factual allegations in her NTA and conceded the charge oftemovability. See Ex 2. Thus, removability was established by Respondent's admissions, See INA § 240(c)(2); 8 CER. §§ 1240.8, 1240.10(c). After Respondent declined to designate a country for removal, the Court designated Honduras for that purpose, INA § 241(6)2); 8 CFR. § 1240-10(0) On April 6, 2015, Respondent filed a Form [-589 Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal withthe Immigration Court Ex. 4.

SUMMARY OF CLAIM and for Withholding of Removal, filed ry submission regarding country conditions, Exhibit Respondent testified that she is @ native and citizen of Honduras. She came to the United was going to kill her. She also testified that she left tienced due to her race and Garifuna ethnicity. The Respondent is « member of the Garifina community, which is a community of Aitican descent in Honduras, She testified that in Honduras people ‘who are ethnically Garifna face constant discrimination and racism. Respondent testified that as a Garifuna she has no vote or say about what happens in her county. She stated that Garifunas are marginalized and live far away from other people They do not have a police station in her community fmm Sl @iagmy. She stated that there is a police Station in another community but it is not run by Garifunas. According to the Respondent, the police have no regard for people of her race. She testified as an example that when she was abused by the father of her children, she had to travel to a different town to file a complaint with the police. ‘The police initially did not take her complaint The respondent testified that there is no employment in her locality. The Respondent has {2.avel long distances in order to find employment. She indicated thatthe government dees nex Lp create jobs in her area. The Respondent testified that potential employers shut the decor vn their face and tll Garifines that they do not want to hite black people. Respondent testified dea she had left her hometown two or three times to find employment. She quoted potential employers as having seid to her: “Get out of here, Get away from here, we are nol going to give Black faces like you jobs.” st fespondent also testified thatthe government of Honduras has not provided schools in the Garifuna communities. In her community, the schools are supported and funded by the Garifune community. The schools are not open every day. She testified that thece arc only three to four teachers in the community trying to do their best, The Respondent testified that the government of Honduras wants to take the land away from the Garifuna people. She believes thatthe government does not want them around because of their skin color ‘The Respondent testified that she has seen individuals of her community being hit by non Garifunas while trying to get on the bus. She also recounted how her daughter had to travel tol s Ceiba which is outside of their community in order to attend school. On one occasion while he Gauahter was travelling on a bus filled with other Garifune students, their bus was shot at by noce Garifuna people. She stated that many students were killed. Her daughter returned home, very scared. According to the Respondent the perpetrators were not held accountable. The Respondent also testified on cross-examination that her community also has no hospital. ‘Whenever her ex-partner injured her, she had to go see a nurse who works in a howe where people in the community ean go for treatment. Respondent described the nurse as « healee and a leader in her community. The Respondent testified that if she were to return to Honduras she would experience, further mistreatment because of her race and the father of her children would also mistreat her. LEGAL STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS A. Credibility Having considered the totality of circumstances, the Court finds that Respondent's testimony was credible, See INA §§ 208(b)1)(B)(ii), 240(0)(4(C). Her testimony was detailed, plausible, internally consistent, and consistent with her documentary evidence. Respondent also corroborated her testimony. INA § 208(6)(1)(B)(i). She presented two witnesses, er boyfriend, SRD cod her brother, CM. These two credible witnesses corroborated the Respondent's claim, Asylum An asylum applicant may demonstrate that she is a “refugee” in either of two ways. First, she may demonstrate that she suffered past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, Ferberstip ina particular social group, o political pinion, INA §§101(a)(2KA), 208(6)1}(AY, 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1). Seeond, she may demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution ‘on account of a protected ground by demonstrating that she subjectively fears persecution and that her fear is objectively reasonable. INA § 101(a)(42)(A); Ramsameachire Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). Respondent claims that she has suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of ber Garifuna race and ethnicity 1, Garifuna race and ethnicity Past persecution Economic Persecution Courts have long recognized that certain economic sanctions can rise to the level of retsecution. See, eg.. Dunat v. Humey, 297 F.2d 744, 746 (34 Cir. 1961) (interpreting former version of withholding-of-removal provision requiring “physical persecution” and holding that economic persecution can suffice because “[t}he denial of an opportunity to eam a livelihood in a country such as the one involved here is the equivalent ofa sentence to death by means of slow Starvation and none the less final because itis gradual”); accord Diminich v. Esperdy. 299 F.2d 244, 247 (2d Cir.1961) (noting “Full [ ] agree{ment]” with Dunats holding on economic persecution). {Persecution requires a showing of more than mere economic discrimination. Ahmed y Ashcroft, 41 F.3d 214 (3d Cit. 2003). The economic difficulties must be above and beyond those Bsenerally shared by others in the country of origin and involve noticeably more than mere loss of focal advantages or physical comforts. Cheng Kai Fu v. INS, 386 F.24 750, 753 (2d Ci. 1967) Rather, the harm must be “ofa deliberate and severe nature and such that is condemned by civilized governments.” HR, Rep. No. 95-1452, at 7, as reprinted in 1978 US.C.CAN, at 4706\"", Matter of T-Z-, 241 & N Dec. 163, 173 (BIA 2014) Matter of T-Z-, 241 & N Dec. 163 (BIA 2007), instructs that an economic sanction Constitutes persecution i i (1) * “deprives [the victim] of liberty, food, housing, employment or other essentials of lif,’ * or (2) deliberately imposes a ‘severe economic disadvantage,’ 24 1 &N, Dec. at 171 (emphasis omitted) (quoting H.R-Rep. No, 95-1452, at 5 (1978), reprinted in 1978 US.C.C.AN, 4700, 4704). The first prong of this standard is intended to reference “deliberate deprivation of basic necessities such that life or freedom is threatened.” Id. atl. ihe second prong references sanctions thet, while not actually threatening lift or Ireedom, nonetheless “reduce an applicant to an impoverished existence.\"" Id. at 174 Peonomic sanctions that might manifest persecution include “particularly onerous fine[s} cal confiscation[s) of property,” and “sweeping limitation{s] of opportunities to Continue to work in an established profession or business.” Id. There is, however, no fixed threshold for the economic harms that will manifest persecution, Instead, wheter a given ceonomic sanction constitutes persecution turns on its “impact” on the violin.

Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, 633 F.3d at 72 (Internal quotation marks omitted). Respondent testified credibly that she and her family have experienced past persecution on account of their race. The Respondent described the efforts made by the government of Honduras to take the land where the Garifina live, fish, and farm away from them. The Respondent alee described how it has been impossible for her to find employment and how Potential employers have slammed their doors on her face and told her that they do not hire “black faces” like here She also spoke about how the government provides no law enforcement in her locality and no schools for Garifuna children, The Respondent also described an incident in which the bus hey Gughter was travelling in to goto school outside her locality was shot at by non-Garifuna people. She also testified that she has no vote or say about what happens in her country, The Respondent's claim for asylum is corroborated by the Department of State Honduras 2018 Human Rights Report. The Report indicates at page one that human rights issues in Honduras include threats and violence against indigenous and Afro-descendent communities. The Report further corroborates the Respondent's claim regarding the government's role in the eviction of the Garifuna from their land. The Report states “ Ethnic minority rights leaders, international NGOs, and farmworker organizations continued to claim that the government failed to redress zction, taken by security forces, government agencies, and private individuals and businesses to dislodge farmers and indigenous persons from lands over Which they claimed ownership based on land reform law or ancestral lend titles. The Report further states at page twenty that indigenous communities which include the Garifuna have limited representation in the national government and consequently little direct input into decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. Persons from indigenous and Afro-descendent communities continued to experience discrimination in employment, education, housing, and health servieee Tab LL ‘The respondent also complained regarding the lack of education in her community and the fact that her daughter faced danger as she had to travel outside of her community to attend school in La Ceiba. The challenges the Garifuna face in the realm of education are detailed in the parnground Report on The Carina of Honduras at Tab Y of Ex. 7 which i in part sponsoced by the U.S. AID, Virginia Tech and Penn Siate etc. At page 13 the report states follows:\""{mJultiple authors descrite the Honduran education system as mated with a lack ct valuation and understanding of the Garifuna culture and language as well as bias act discrimination (Alvarez, 2008; Anderson, 2000; Craven, 2006; Peanny, 2010; Kleyn, 2010; Lara, 2002). The vast majority of teachers in Garifina communities ate mestizo and Spanish is a language of instruction from pre-school through university in all eommunities, including Garifarg Speaking communities (Alvarez, 2008; Kleyn, 2010), “Therefore, learning Spanish is not much at & choice but an obligatory means to teceive the benefit of the formal education system in the Spunuy” (Alvarez, 2008, p 117). Schools are deseribed es hostile for culturally and Hnguistclly ivcrse students, particularly those of indigenous and ATfro-descendent origin (Craven, 2006, Anderson, 2000; Alvarez, 2008; Feanny, 2006). There isa prevailing perception that the sehoct system is unsupportve ofthe Garifuna and other indigenous cultures, “The school system has led teachers and students to the conslusion that Garin and indigenous languages ae for primitive, non-edueated, and ignorant people, and the usc of these languages on schoo! campuses has been totally prohibited” (Alvarez, 2008, p. 140), Anderson (2000) notes in his research on Gatifies chilére), that stereotypes and racial biases are present in the school system, giving multiple examples of educators in both public and private schools including that: “The principal of the largest public Colegio in La Ceiba stated bluntly that ‘negros are slow [lentos|, in the sense at {euming, In general, their level of learning is below ours [mestizos] There are few negros whe are brilliant” (p. 274), ‘The evidence shows that indigenous and A fro-descendant people suffer from. higher levels of poverty than the rest of the country's population, Intra-American Commission on Human Rights, Situation of Human Rights in Honduras, (December 31, 2015) at Paragraph 417 at 159. The evidence also shows that the government of Honduras is an active participant in the eviction of the Gavifuna from the lands that they depend on for their survival, ' This court finds that the Respondent has established that as a Garifuna she and her family have been deprived. o¢ _ The Minority Rights Report-Garifuna states that Tourism-related issues pose the greatest danger on the mainland and atleast four Garifuna communities on the north coast of Honduras are under unprecedented threat of disappearance. In 2001 the Honduran Tourism Secretary claimed publicly that hundreds of kilometers of pristine sun-drenched North Coast beaches were being wasted and should be ‘developed for strong tourism.” In the years tat followed many Garifuna have been evicted from their land in the Tela Bay region in northem Honduras, sach as in Tomabé by government designation of a National Park and an environmental protested arex This property was later transferred to the Honduran Tourism Institute (IHT) which engaged in Joint ventures with private seetor interests. In addition, in Tela Bay in September 2014, armed police evicted approximately 400 Garifuna individuals from land that was later illegally so! to San Pedro Sula businessmen. Repression has oveurred against Garifune leaders and communities working to defend communal {errtony resources and culture from the mega-projet. They have faced arson attacks, trumped up criminal charges, as well as abduction and threats at gunpoint by paramilitaries hited by real estate companies secking to pressure Garifuuna to sell their land employment, housing, education, health services and the protection of law enforcement, which are all essentials of life. The above in the aggregate rises ta the level of persecution, The Respondent also alleges that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her Garifuna ethnic and racial identity, If an applicant has not demonstrated pect Berecution she may nonetheless demonstrate statutory eligibility for asylum by establishing tht she has a well-founded fear of future Persecution. See 8 C.E.R. § 1208.13()(2). An applicant is not required to provide evidence that she would be “singled out individually” for persecution in the country of removal if she establishes that, inthe country fram which she is seeking asylum “there is pattem or practice . .. of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated vo rhe applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or Political opinion,” and thatthe applicant is included in and identifies with that group, such they hog ‘ear of persecution upon return is reasonable,” 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(2\\ili); see also Shao s Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 150 n.6 (2d Cir. 2008) (Pattern-and-practice analysis affords a petitioner who cannot credibly demonstrate a reasonable possibility that he will be targeted as an individual for future persecution an alternative means to demonstrate that his fear of persecution is objectively reasonable.”), To establish his eligibility for asylum based upon a pattem or practice cr Persecution, an applicant must demonstrate that the persecution against the group in which he is included is “systemic or pervasive.” Matter of A-M-, 23 I&N Dec. 737, 741 (BIA 2005). Respondent also alleges that thee is a pater ot practice of persecution against similarly situated individuals in Honduras. The Court finds that the country conditions evidence indicates Giscrimination agains! the Garifuna community thats so “systemic or pervasive” that it constitutes a threat to life or freedom. See Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222 In light of all the above, this Court finds that the Respondent has met her bur den of proof and bas established her eligibility for political asylum in the United States IV.

On October 29, 2019, the Court held an individual hearing on the merits of @Aaumiay applications for relief. For the following reasons, the Court grants her application for asylum and, as a result, also grants igqumgys derivative application for asylum. I, SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE A. Documentary Evidence Exhibit 1: NTA for‘sieaimiaimip filed June 1, 2015; Exhibit 1A: NTA for Magu filed June 1, 2015; Exhibit 2; Form 1-589 and Supporting Documents, including Tabs B-D,! filed February 25, 2016; Exhibit 3: Additional Documents in Support of Form I-589, including Tabs E-F, filed August 24, 2016; Exhibit 4: luuautimis Sworn Statement, filed Septémber 26, 2017; Exhibit 5: Additional Documents in Support of Form 1-589, including Tabs G-M, filed October 15, 2019; and Exhibit 6: Nasimaiuaiie, Statement on Qualifying Particular Social Groups, filed October 15, 2019? B, Testimonial Evidence On October 29, 2019, the Court heard testimony from Masiiaimie The testimony provided in support of her applications for relief, although considered by the Court in its entirety, is not fully repeated herein as it is already part of the record. Rather, her testimony is summarized below to the extent it is relevant to the subsequent analysis. (Gimmie was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and was twenty-six years old at the time of her individual hearing. She and her partner, Sia.) have two children together: SMW, who was six years old at the time of the individual hearing, and SE 2 US. citizen who was one year old. SURMNMMMs mother and two sisters still reside in Honduras, insist filed Exhibit 2, with her Form 1-589 marked as Tab A, at a master calendar hearing on February 25, 2016, Ex.2, Tab A. However, the presiding immigration judge at that hearing inadvertently failed to stamp the Form 1-589 to indicate that she filed it on that date. Thus, the Court here notes that Mimimidaw timely filed her Form 1-589 on February 25, 2016, as the audio recording of proceedings in this matter clearly reflects, despite the fact the document bears a stamp indicating she filed it on August 24, 2016. See INA § 208(a)(2)(B). 7 ‘he Court mere AA Sistment on Qualf¥ing Particular Socal Groups fr identification purposes only as it is not evidence, but rather legal argument. See Ex. 6. Page 2 of 16 ate eememvepENITTennas emsiitie Prior to departing Honduras, Sati attended liigh school and worked in the accounting department at Imagen Global, a company that manufactured billboards. Around 2012, when she was eighteen years old, she met a man named deagediaummimatiatiieagaitgminene claimed to be very well connected, wealthy, and powerful; he was related to the owners of Imagen Global, as well as Natividad’s landlord. mimagaig parents owned their own company called Cable Sula, which supposedly provided cable and internet services. However, those services were merely a fagade for their criminal enterprises, including money laundering and drug trafficking schemes, See harassed MeN at work nearly every day, telling her that he so frequently visited the company because he wanted to see her. He told her that he desired to date her because she was an attractive “chick,” unlike the other women he “had before.” When she rejected his advances, he claimed that “nobody says no” to him and, if she did not oblige, he would “do it the bad way.” He also bragged to Nasimalael about his family’s illicit dealings, encouraging her to work for his family because he could “profit” off her. He explained that his family paid the police for protection and impunity. When she declined to join his family’s black-market businesses, he repeated that “nobody says no” to him. Nevertheless, Smillie continued to reject his aggressive advances. One day, while ‘animale! waited in front of Imagen Global after work for her bus home, ‘Sqm approached her in his car. He pointed a gun at her and demanded that she enter the car, threatening to shoot her, She complied. He continued to point the gun at her as he drove the car to nearby secluded hills. He stopped the car, brandished a blade, and then raped her. He cut her multiple times, resulting in deep gashes on her arm, leg, and back. Afterwards, he left her in the street, and she hitchhiked home. As a result of the rape and beating, she was severely bruised, bloodied, and lacerated, - Two days after this rape, Jaggp and two other men approached lame at their home and threatened to kill him if he did not end his relationship with Mimi. Thereafter, one of Sami associates repeatedly and menacingly rode pest Mammals home on a motorcycle. @Allajom recognized the associate, as he had previously approached her at a store and told her that she was going to receive “alittle surprise” from Sr Following the abuse, MINIM filed a police report against @age. However, she was hesitant to do so because the Honduran police are corrupt and only protect affluent individuals, As she reported (gage abuse, the police officer who took the report asked her whether she knew what she was “getting into” when she identified @jjugggas the perpetrator. She felt compelled to omit or distort certain details of the event in order to mitigate any retaliation that could arise from her complaint, as dicated his family bribed the police for protection and impunity. For example, she inaccurately told the police officer that grad abandoned her. She also declined to explicitly mention that taggggpraped her and instead only claimed that he “touched” her, While she was at the police station, the police officer input Sqqgi/s name into the police database, which revealed multiple complaints against him related to his mistreatment of other women. Subsequently, SIM forcibly entered ANNB's home and kidnapped her. He forced her into a car and, accompanied by three other men and a Woman, brought $l to an unknown location. He held her there for about three days and repeatedly raped her. ‘The other men and ‘woman watched as he raped her. He cursed at her and beat her, punching and kicking her face and head. He reminded her that he told her he would ‘do things the bad way” if she did not “accept” Page 3 of 16 Pa aman ad him. He threatened to kill Mammut, and, eventually, the woman helped to convince dame 10 allow @dmmimiiad to leave, ° ‘Thereafter, (MMB left her home to seek protection at various other locations. She moved to her mother’s home in Loma Larga, San Antonio de Cortes, Honduras, about three hours away from her home. She stayed there for a few days, before moving to a friend's home in Siguatepeque, Comayagua, Honduras. She also spent some time at a hospital during and after Gapmmnis birth. Meanwhile, Sp sent her text messages indicating that he was looking for her and intended to Kill her, He also repeatedly called her, as well as Sib, and posted threatening messages on her Facebook page; for example, he claimed'that he was going to find her and kill her “wherever” she was, referring to her as a “bitch.” She believes he was searching for her in order to traffic her to Guatemala and force her to join his prostitution and drug distribution businesses, Shortly thereafter, she fled Honduras, In May 2015, SQM entered the United States with jgmmge. Immigration officials apprehended her and Sjjqpe upon their arrival. Although documents filed by DHS suggest ‘Mamita told immigration officials she did not fear return to Honduras, she claimed that she did indeed state a fear of harm upon her retum due to the ablise she suffered, as well as the rampant crime in the country. Nevertheless, the immigration officials allegedly responded to her claim with rebufis, retorting that “all immigrants lie” and provide the same narrative underlying their requests for protection. After her arrival, SIMI leamed that S¥jgy was murdered. She fears returning to Honduras because of the abuse she suffered and lack of government protection she was provided. Every time she looks at the scars on her body, she remembers the times #qN¥ raped her and beat her. On two occasion, she unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide. Six months prior to the individual hearing in this matter, JMNM\"" sister received threatening text messages, menacingly asserting that {MIB would soon return to Honduras. Honduras is rife with crime and corruption and the authorities do not protect women, in part due to cultural machismo, Sala believes that, regardless of where they lived in the country, the government would not protect her or her children from violence. Indeed, multiple members of ‘MEMB: family have been murdered. Men wearing police uniforms murdered pregnant sister-in-law. §SMMMINNNIS father was also murdered. The police neither performed an autopsy on her father nor pursued any suspects of the twg murders. For those reasons, 5 requests protection in the United States. Tl. LAW, ANALYSIS, AND FINDINGS The Court has reviewed all evidence and testimony in the record, even if not specifically addressed in this decision, and has given the evidence appropriate weight. See generally Orellana y, Barr, 925 F.3d 145, 153 (4th Cit. 2019); Alvarez Lagos v, Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 251 (4th Cit. 2019). . A. Credibility and Corroboration When an applicant offers testimonial evidence to support an application for relief, the Court must assess credibility. See INA § 240(c)(4)(B). The REAL ID Act of 2005 governs the credibility analysis for cases in which the applicant filed for relief on or after May 11, 2005. Matter Page 4 of 16 | ee Of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42, 42-43 (BIA 2006). In making a credibility determination, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors. INA § 240(c)(4)(C); see Matter of J-Y-C., 24 T&N Dec. 260, 266 (BIA 2007), Generally, a witness must provide detailed, plausible, and consistent testimony. INA § 240(c)(4)(B). To be credible, the witness’s testimony should satisfactorily explain any material discrepancies-or omissions, INA § 240(c)(4)(C). A court may also base a credibility determination on a witness’s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness, and the inherent plausibility of the witness's account, Id Additionally, a court may consider the consistency between a witness's written and oral statements; the intemal consistency of each such statement; the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record; and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to’ whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the epplicant’s claim. Id. ‘An applicant also “bears the burden to provide réasonably available supporting evidence for material facts that are central to [her] claim,” and the absence of “corroborating evidence [can] lead to a finding that an applicant did not meet [her] burden of proof.” Matter of L-A-C-, 26 1&N Dec, 516, 519 (BIA 2015) (citing Matter of S-McJ-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 725-26 (BIA 1997). However, an applicant's own testimony, without corroborating evidence, may be sufficient proof to support an application if that testimony is believable, consistent, and detailed enough to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis for the fear of persecution. Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 439, 445 (BIA 1987); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a), Considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Court finds Geteamtamis testimony generally credible. See INA § 240(c)(4)(C). The Court notes some areas of concem, but finds that she satisfactorily explained them, or that they are too minor to warrant an adverse credibility finding, DHS did not explicitly contest the credibility of Saaammgpe testimony but did inquire as to certain inconsistencies in the record during cross-examination, Itis true that some of SUNIBNNINs testimony regarding the events occurring before and after the abuse she suffered were inconsistent with her written statements, For example, her declaration states that her landlord’s son introduced her to tgp, while she testified that she met ip at Imagen Global. Ex. 2, Tab B at 13. However, she credibly explained that @ggp was related to both her landlord and the owners of Imagen Global; thus, it is not inconceivable that she had interactions with (both by virtue of her employment at Imagen Global as well as through her relationship with her landlord. Additionally, the police report indicates that Iliad informed the police officers that i@gqumge had abandoned her after learning about the rape, while she testified that such abandonment never occurred. Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-36. Yet, this inconsistency is minor, and Nagin! adequately explained that she believed she needed to distort her account of the abuse to mitigate any possible retaliation arising from her contact with the authorities, in light of government corruption. Notably, moreover, she explained that $¥ggjB had connections with law enforcement and also explicitly threatened to kill IJINIWR. See also Ex. 5, Tab I at 221 (stating that §@ugr “had friends in the police”). Thus, it is plausible that {JUNNNNNMB! dishonestly informed the police that #¥gmml abandoned her in order to protect him fom Mp and his criminal associates. Such inconsistencies do not merit an adverse credibility finding, INA § 240(c)(4)(C). Finally, there were inconsistencies within WME s accounts of the repeated rapes and beating from which she suffered. However, it has long been documented that victims of severe Page 5 of 16 abuse often struggle to recall certain details of the trauinatizing events. Moreover, victims of sex crimes often suffer “from further trauma and embarrassment” when discussing the harm they suffered and, thus, may be reluctant to fully describe the abuse, instead providing different details during different retellings. Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk County, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982). Relatedly, DHS stipulated that qqutmiam could provide cursory testimony regarding the abuse she suffered in order to avoid retraumatization, “Wiliam also credibly explained that her descriptions of the attacks differed because of the emotional distress such retellings induce, Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the inconsistencies in *mmiagie testimony and written statements are excusable.* INA § 240(c)(4)(C). As such, the Court finds that Salil testified credibly. Her testimony generally provides a plausible, coherent, and sufficiently consistent and detailed basis for her claims. Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. at 445; 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a). It was also largely consistent with her Form 1-589 and the objective evidence in the record. See generally Ex. 2, Tab D at 24-124; Ex. 3, Tab F at 128- 88; Ex. 5, Tab M at 244-441, She was candid and forthright, even as to unfavorable facts. The Court observed her demeanor as she testified and did not‘identify any effort to obfuscate the truth in order to bolster her claims. Additionally, she was responsive to DHS’s questions and honestly attempted to address inconsistencies in the record. She also provided some corroborating evidence, including a declaration from her sister, the police report, and an article aboutdlmp. See Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-43. Accordingly, the Court finds (Mllmiés testimony both credible and generally corroborated. INA § 240(c)(4)(B). B. Asylum . To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate she is a “refugee” within the meaning of INA § 101(a)(42). INA § 208(b)(1)(BX(i). To satisfy the “refugee” definition, an applicant must demonstrate that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin because of a “well-founded fear” of future persecution on account of one of the five statutory grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA § 101(2)(42)(A). If an applicant establishes that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, then she benefits from a rebuttable presumption that she also has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.FR. § 1208.13(6)(1). An applicant must also establish that the persecution was or will be at the hands of the applicant’s government or a private actor the government is unwilling or unable to control. See Crespin- 7 See Robert Timothy Reagan, Scientific Consensus on Memory Repression and Recovery, 51 Rutgers L. Rev. 275 (1999); Sheree L. Toth & Dante Cicchetti, Remembering, Forgetting, and the Effects of Trawma on Memory: A Developmental Pochopatalogy Perspstive (1998; Maura Dougherty, Evaluating Recovered Memories of Trauma as Evidence, 25-IAN Colo. Law. I (1996). + With regard to the encounter between NNN and immigration officials at the border, the Court does not find thatthe contradictory statements allegedly made to them undercut the credibility of her statements in her testimony and declaration. Indeed, such interviews at ports of entry “are brief affairs given in the hous immediately following long and often dangerous journeys into the United Stats.” Qing Hua Lin, Holder, 736 F.3d 343, 352-53 (4th Cir. 2013). Mum testimony and demeanor also clearly show she genuinely fears retum to Honduras, notwithstanding the immigration officials’ record stating she did not express such a fear. The Court declines to comment on the proprity of any elleged derogatory statements made by the immigration officials and instead cites generally to SC-ER. § 2635.101 Page 6 of 16 OO Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir, 2011). The applicant also must demonstrate that one of the protected ground was or will be at least one central reason for her persecution, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)Gi). Finally, the applicant must show thaf the court should favorably exercise its discretion to grant asylum. INA § 208(b)(1)(A); 8 CER. § 1208.14(a), Wee claims that she suffered past persecution at the hands of @qagp and his criminal associates on account of her membership in the particular social group composed of “Honduran women.” See Ex. 6 at 5.° For the following reasons, the Court grants MINI asylum application. 1. Past Persecution Persecution within the meaning of the Act is harm surpassing the level of “mere harassment,” and occurring at the hands of the applicant's government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, on account of a protected ground. Li Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir, 2005) (quoting Dandan v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 567, 573 (7th Cir. 2003); Crespin. Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128; see Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). a. Harm Rising to the Level of Persecution “Persecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the refugee definition,” Bakaron v, Holder, 588 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Li, 405 F.3d at 177). In determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of persecution, the Fourth Circuit has observed that persecution is systematic, whereas less-severe mistreatment is generally limited to isolated incidents. Id. Thus, when the alleged mistreatment is in the form of brief-detentions, repeated interrogations, or “{mJinor beatings,” courts generally do not regard it as persecution. Li, 405 F.3d at 177 (quoting Kondakova v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 792, 797 (8th Cir. 2004)), In contrast, the Fourth Circuit has expressly held that “the threat of death alone constitutes persecution,” even without more, Tairow v, Whitaker, 909 F.3d 702, 707-08 (4th Cir. 2018); Hernandez-Avalos v, Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126); but see Cortez-Mendez v. Whitaker, 912 F.3d 205, 209 n, (4th Cir. 2019) (a death threat may not always rise to the level of persecution if itis too “distant,” “unspecific,” or remote in time and place). Rape may also rise to the level of persecution, See Matter of D-V-, 21 I&N Dec. 77, 79-80 (BIA 1993). A court must consider all of the threats and harm “[iJn the aggregate” to determine whether an applicant has suffered past persecution. Matter of O-Z- & I-Z-, 22 1&N Dec. 23, 25-26 (BIA 1998). ‘The Court finds Saasaitimg has established that she suffered past harm rising to the level of persecution. DHS does not argue otherwise, The éredible testimonial and documentary evidence in the record show that ijl kidnapped, repeatedly raped, and beat (NINN See Ex, 2, Tab B at 14, Such abuse constitutes persecutory mistreatment. D-V-, 21 I&N Dee. at 79-80. Jorge then . ‘WeemNNPEBN also argues that she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of other alleged protected grounds; however, for the sake of administrative efficiency, the Court declines to address those asserted grounds as MMMM has met her burden to show that she has a fear of future persecution on account of her membership in the cognizable social group composed of “Honduran women.” See INS v. Lopes. “Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040 (1984) (noting removal hearings “provide a streamlined determination of eligibility to remain inthis county\"") Page 7 of 16 niensereomnstinitintnnoreneseamnngsisapmeetibiattttlemiibs aitiaideeecaaatitataiy continually lodged credible threats—including death threats—against Natividad, which also constitute harm rising to the level of persecution. Tairou, 909 F.3d at 707-08; Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949; see also Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; Ex. 5, Tab Lat 221, Siqqgp and his associates’ persistent pursuit of Smmimimigab was not contained to isolated incidents; they repeatedly threatened to kill her, Geum, and QM, Baharon, 588 F.3d at 232; Ex. 2, Tab B at 15; Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. Thus, ‘iets has met her burden to establish past harm of sufficient severity to constitute persecution. Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 128. b. Government Unwilling or Unable to Control An applicant for asylum must show she fears persecution by the government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950; Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222. Whether the government is unable or unwilling to control private actors must be determined on a case-by-case basis. See Crespin-Vatladares, 632 F.3d 117, 128-29 (4th Cir. 2011), “[T]he mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes . cannot itself establish an asylum claim.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 320 (A.G. 2018), abrogated on other grounds by Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F.Supp.3d 96 (D-D.C. Cir. 2018). Moreover, in Orellana v. Bare, the Fourth Circuit explained that an applicant's failure to report abuse “does not prove the availability of govemment protection.” 925 F.3d 145, 153 (4th Cir. 2019). Even if an applicant sought government protection, mere “access to a nominal or ineffectual remedy,” or “empty or token “assistance,” is not sufficient to establish that the government is able to control a private persecutor—a sepiirate and distinct question from whether itis willing to do so. Id. at 151-52 & n.3 (citing Rahimzadeh v, Holder, 613 F.3d 916, 921 (9th Cir. 2010). Finally, an applicant need not have persisted in secking goverment protection if doing so would have been futile or resulted in further abuse. Id. at 153 (citing Ornelas-Chavez v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2006)). The Court finds that Mawimimb has met her burden of proving that the Honduran government is unable or unwilling to protect her. Importantly, she credibly testified that she contacted law enforcement and filed a police report, a copy of which she provided to the Court. Ex. 5, Tab L at 232-36. She further explained that the police officer who documented her complaint asked her whether she knew what she was “getting into” when she identified Samp as the perpetrator. See also Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. In spite of her effort to report the abuse, the record suggests that the Honduran government took no action at all. Jd at 14-15; Ex. 5, Tab K at 230, DHS argues that, because &ialllMBl only filed one police report, whereas the petitioner in Orellana contacted law enforcement multiple times, the Gourt should find that Nwaimitl failed to show that the government is unwilling or unable to protect her, It further argues that she failed to ‘meet her burden because, when she did actually file a police report, she lied about the relevant events. First, the Court does not read into the relevant law any requirement regarding the number of police reports an asylum applicant must file to show that a government is unwilling or unable to control a persecutor. Indeed, an applicant is not required to show that she filed even one complaint, particularly if doing so would be futile or risk further abuse, Orellana, 925 F.3d at 153. Futility and risk were high in Nimiminmiés decision to report aijagyr she credibility testified that ‘Sump told her that his family bribed the police for protection and impunity, an assertion which is supported by his family’s elevated social status. See Ex. 5, Tab I at 221 (stating that Slg*had friends in the police”); id, Tab L at 239 (referring to JagggPas the son of “entrepreneurs” and Page 8 of 16 owners of Cable Sula); id, Tab M at 244 (noting “widespread government corruption” and impunity). Second, while it is true that Nasimiigg) did not accurately describe to the police the ‘traumatic abuse she suffered, her dishonesty was justified. AAs explained above, she distorted the relevant events in an attempt to mitigate any potential retaliation arising ftom her complaint, as well as to protect Jilmmip. 1d. at 233-34, Her reasonable decision to do so is supported by objective evidence showing government corruption, as well as her testimony that the officer who took the report suggested that reporting the abuse was unwise. Sée also Ex. 2, Tab B at 15; Ex. 5, Tab I at 221; id., Tab M at 239, 331. Nevertheless, regardless of the number of complaints SNMNMIWMfiled or the contents therein, she did report clearly criminal conduct to the police, yet the authorities took no action at all. See Ex. 5, Tab L at 233-34. Such inaction aligns with IMNlM’s credible testimony that Honduran law enforcement is corrupt and only protects wealthy individuals. In fact, “(t]he police force is reported to be one of the most corrupt and mistrusted in Latin America.” Id, Tab M at 331. For example, there have been “several reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawfal killings.” Id. at 245. Numerous government officials have also been exposed for their illicit dealings, including “attempted murder” and “premediated killings.” Id. at 246, Relatedily, many police officers have “faced prosecution or were convicted in the United States for involvement in organized crime.” Id, at 283, Nevertheless, such corruption in the government is “reported to continue to contribute to widespread impunity for crimes committed by members of drug smuggling structures.” Id at 332. Asa result of rampant crime and government comuption, “there are no areas in major urban cities fee of violent crime.” Id. at 286. Indeed, “[v}iolent crime is rampant in Honduras,” and women and girls in particular “face high levels of gender-related violence.” Id. at 283, 281. Passengers on public transportation are often raped, robbed, kidnapped, and murder. Id at 287, The corrupt government even struggles to control crime in its prisons, which are saturated with “pervasive gang-related violence.” Id. at 249. Moreover, abundant independent evidence in the record generally shows that “[o}tganized criminal elements,” such as those in which dg family and associates were involved, were “significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed acis of murder, extortion, kidnapping, torture, [and] human trafficking,” often targeting “members of vulnerable populations,” including “women.” Id. at 244, 247, 252, 263. Thus, the record reflects that the Honduran government does not merely “have problems” policing “certain crimes.” 4-B-, 27 I&N Dec, at 320. Instead, itis a significant part of the broader problem itself. See Ex. 5, Tab M at 405 (reporting that “{{Jhe Honduran government has been unable and unwilling to protect ‘women from various forms of violence through direct action, such as engaging in their persecution and killings”). Finally, while the record does show that some sectors of the government make some efforts to protect residents, “nominal or ineffectual’¥assistance is insufficient to demonstrate ‘that the government is willing or able to protect MMMM. Orellana, 925 F.3d.at 152, In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that S¥QNNNN99 has shown that the government of Honduras is unable or unwilling to protect her. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 950. ¢. Membership in a Cognizable Particular Social Group An applicant for asylum alleging persecution orf-account of membership in a particular social group must show that she is a member of a cognizable “particular social group” within the Page 9 of 16 agg rrngpeemnsnensenrinrestientenommiemeeaness nn meaning of the Act. See INA § 101(a)(42)(A). A cognizable particular social group must be “(1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec, 227, 237 (BIA 2014); see Temu v. Holder, 740 F.3d 887, 892 (4th Cir. 2014). ‘Siento: argues that she suffered persecutory abuse on account of her membership in the particular social group composed of “Honduran women.” See Ex. 6 at 5. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes this is a cognizable particular social group under the Act, First, the Court finds Honduran women share an-immutable characteristio—the fact that they are Honduran women. One’s sex and nationality are so fundamental to identity that one should not be required to change them in order to avoid persecution. See Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 233 (recognizing that sex is an immutable characteristic); Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 366 (BIA 1996) (“The characteristic{] of being a ‘young woman’. . . cannot be changed.”); see also Perdomo v. Holder, 611 F.3d 662, 666-67 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2010); see also INA § 101(a)(42)(A) isting nationality, inter alia, as protected grounds). Accordingly, the Court finds that the group “Honduran women’ is comprised of members who share a common immutable characteristic, M- E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 237, ~ Next, the Court finds that the group “Honduran women” is defined with sufficient particularity. To satisfy the particularity requirement, a proposed group “must be defined by characteristics that"
,"provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group.” M-E- V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 239; accord Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253. “The group must also be discrete and have definable boundaries—it must not be amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective.” M-E-V-G-, 26 I8:N Dec. at 239; see also Zelaya v. Holder, 668 F.3d 159, 165 (4th Cir. 2012) (stating that a particular social group must “b8 defined with sufficient particularity to avoid indeterminacy”), “(T]he size and breadth of a group alone does not preclude a group from qualifying as [a particular] social group.” Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253 (quoting Perdomo, 611 F.3d at 669) (intemal quotation marks omitted); see also Reyes v, Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125, 1135 (9th Cir. 2016). This is in keeping with the other protected grounds in the statutory series—for example, there may be tens of millions of members of a certain race or religion in a given country, but this fact does not preclude any one of those members from qualifying for asylum if they can show persecution on account of race or religion, See INA § 101(a)(42)(A); see also M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 234 (applying the ejusdem generis canon of construction to construe the statutory phrase “membership in a particular social group” harmoniously with the other four protected grounds). Indeed, the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) has held cognizable numerous particular social groups that have a high number of members. See, e.g., Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. 819, 822- 23 (BIA 1990) (finding that the grouping of homosexuals in Cuba is sufficiently particular); Matter of H-, 21 I&N Dec. 337, 343 (BIA 1996) (concluding that memibers of the Marehan subclan in Somalia belong to a sufficiently particular group); Matter of V-T-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 792, 798 (BIA. 1997) (finding that Filipinos of mixed Filipino-Chinese ancestry are members of a sufficiently particular group). Moreover, a group need not have “an element of ‘cohesiveness’ or homogeneity among group members” for it to satisfy the particularity requirement. Matter of C-A-, 23 1&N Dec. 951, 957 (BIA 2006). Page 10 of 16 ere e ere nsanncemmansneRENEPSN OS. In Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, the Board ruled that “affluent Guatemalans” are not members of a cognizable particular social group, holding that “[iJhe terms ‘wealthy’ and ‘affluent? standing alone are too amorphous to provide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership.” 24 1&N Dec. 69, 74 (BIA'2007). In Temu, the Fourth Circuit commented that the group in A-M-E- & J-G-U-, “affluent Guatemalans,” was not defined with particularity “because the group changes dramatically based on who defines it.” 740 F.3d at 895, The Fourth Circuit explained that “[a]éfluent might include the wealthiest 1% of Guatemalans, or it might include the wealthiest 20%,” and that the group therefore “lacked boundaries that are fixed enough to qualify asa particular social group.” Id. Unlike the group “affluent Guatemalans,” the group “Honduran women” does not change based on who defines it, and therefore it has boundaries that are fixed enough to meet the particularity requirement. There is a clear and unambiguous benchmark to determine who is a member of the group—Honduran women are members; Honduran men and people of other nationalities are not, This is not a subjective or amorphous criterion, See Temu, 740 F.3d at 895, Nor do the size or internal diversity of the group “Honduran women” imply that the group is not particular, any more than the size or intemal diversity of the groups “homosexuals in Cuba” or “Filipinos of mixed Filipino-Chinese ancestry” defeated the particularity of those groups. Toboso- Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. at 822-23; V-T-S-, 21 I&N Dec. at 798; see Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 253 (quoting Perdomo, 611 F.3d at 669) (noting that a large group can be particular); C-4-, 23 1&N Dec. at 957 (explaining that intra-group homogeneity or cohesiveness is not required). The group “Honduran women” is “at least as ‘particular and well-defined’ as other groups whose members have qualified for asylum,” such as “former gang members,” “the educated, landowning class of cattle farmers,” and “Iranian women who advocate women’s rights or who oppose Iranian customs relating to dress and behavior.” See Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 125 (collecting cases) ‘Therefore, the Court finds that the articulated group satisfies the particularity requirement. Finally, the Court finds that the group composed of “Honduran women” is socially distinct. ‘The social distinction inquiry tums on whether the proposed group is “perceived as a group by society”—specifically, “the society in which the claim for asylum arises.” M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 240-41. A group need not be ocularly visible to others in society for it to be socially distinct. Id, at 240. “Although the society in question need not be able to easily identify who is a member of the group, it must be commonly recognized that the shared characteristic is one that defines the group.” Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 217 (BIA 2014). The dispositive reference point in the social distinction analysis is the perception of the society in question, as ‘opposed to the perception of the persecutor. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 241-42. However, the perception of the persecutor “may be relevant, because it can be indicative of whether society views the group as distinct.” Jd. at 242, Evidence that is probative on the issue of social distinction may include “country conditions reports, expert witness testimony, and press accounts of discriminatory laws and policies, historical animosities, and the like.” Id. at 244-47, The fact that members of the proposed group are singled out for greater persecution than the general population is also “highly relevant” to the social distinction analysis, Temu, 740 F.3d at 894, YamMNBER! hes shown that women in Honduras are “set apart” and “distinct” from other persons in Honduras in “some significant way,” and are therefore socially distinct. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238. Generally, the record reflects that, because women in Honduras are seen as, subordinate to the rest of society, they are significantly set apart from the public at large. The Page 11 of 16 ee phenomena of machismo and marianismo, common cultural tenets widely held in Hondurans, give rise to the belief that women are inferior to men and must carry out certain subaltem societal roles. See Ex. 5, Tab M at 362, 369-70, 375. An inherent aspect of these principles is that “men can do anything they want to women in Honduras.” Id. 364. Although the social distinction requirement does not necessitate ocular visibility, the subordination of and violence against women in nearly omnipresent in Honduras. See, e.g, id. at 276, 278, 345-47, 405. Indeed, gender-based violence in Honduras is unavoidable—in the country itself and abroad; for example, only a few years prior to the issuance of this decision, a global beauty pageant contestant and her sister fell victim to femicide; “[t]heir joint funeral was broadcast around the world and attended by thousands.” Id. at 364. The sister was shot by her boyfriend “fbJecause ofthis machismo.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omitted). Such atrocious gender-based violence is commonplace and frequently published in the media. See, e.g., id at 404, Even when not reported in the media, the record reveals that the subordination of Honduran women—and violence against them—is inescapably perceptible. In fact, Honduras “has the highest recorded rate of femicide in Latin America, and also one of the highest rates of femicide among girls... in the world.” [dat 345, 404; Temu, 740 F.3d at 894 (explaining that whether a group “is singled out for greater persecution than the poptilation as a whole” is a “highly relevant factor” in determining social distinction). Such “widespread and systematic” violence against women and girls is carried out by a diverse array of members ofthe public, including “members of gangs and other organized criminal groups, the security services[,] and other individuals.” Id at 345, 244, 247. The ubiquity of the problems Honduran women face is only increasing, as there has been a “recent spiral of violence in the lives of women.” Jd. at 405. For example, one of the many forms of gender-based abuse, domestic violence, is widespread, “as is impunity for the perpetrators.” Id. at 347, “Large numbers of Honduran girls and women .... are also reported to be forced into prostitution in Honduras and trafficked info sex slavery in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, the United States{,] and elsewhere.” Jd at 346, The subordination of women results in obvious barriers to women’s fundamental participation in civil society, such as accessing adequate employment and voting in election, further setting them apart in the margins of society. Id. at 276, 278, 263; id. at 267 (noting that, notwithstanding that “the law accords women and men the same legal rights and status... , many women did not fully enjoy such rights”). Thus, the record clearly reflects that Honduran women are significantly set apart from Guatemalan society at large. As such, the Court finds that S¥qqiqiagpW's proposed group is sufficiently socially distinct, M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee. at 238, Accordingly, the Court concludes that Saai@MNBl is a meraber of the cognizable particular social group composed of “Honduran women.”* See INA § 101 (a)(42)(A). : ‘The notion that women in a given country can form a particular social group is not novel. As noted above, the Board stated in 1985 in Acosta that one’s “sex” is a “shared Eharacteristic” on which particular social group membership can be based. 19 I&N Dec. at 233. In Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth Circuit stated that “the ‘recognition that girls or women ofa particular clan or nationality (or even in some circumstances females in general) ‘may constitute & social group is simply a logical application of our law.” 400 F.3d 785, 797 (Sth Cir. 2003). In its 2010 decision in Perdomo v. Holder, the Ninth Circuit interpreted its Mohammed decision as “clearly acknowledgfing} that women in @ particular country, regardless of ethnicity or clan membership, could form a particular social group.” 611 F.3d 662, 667 (Sth Cir. 2010). Similarly, in Hassan v. Gonzales, the Bighth Cireuit found that “Somali females” are members of é particular social group. 484 F.3d $13, 518 (8th Cir 2007). In Fatin v. INS, the Third Circuit stated Page 12 of 16 | d. Nexus An asylum applicant must demonstrate that a protected ground, such as membership in a particular social group, was “at least one central reason” for the persecution she suffered or fears she would suffer. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dee. 208, 212-14 (BIA 2007). “The applicant need not prove that the protected ground was the central reason or even a dominant central reason for the persecution; she need only show that the protected ground was more than an incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate reason underlying the persecution.” Zavaleta-Policiano v. Sessions, 873 F.3d 241, 247 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009)) (intemal quotation marks omitted), In conducting the nexus analysis, court nfust consider not only the “articulated purpose” of a persecutor's threats, but also the “intertwined reasons” for those threats. Id. at 248 (quoting Cantillano Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 129 (4th Cir. 2017)). A court should consider both direct and circumstantial evidence of a persecutor’s motive, and is free to make reasonable inferences from that evidence. Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 40, 44 (BIA 2017), overruled in part on other grounds, 27 1&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019). ‘The Court finds aN has met her burden of proving that her status a Honduran woman was at least one central reason why damp and his associates targeted her. DHS argues that she failed to establish the requisite nexus because the record merely shows that gi was a stalker ‘who pursued her because he was obsessed with her. While DHS’s theory may be one part of the aggressors’ broader motive, the record clearly reflects that Natividad’s sex and inseparably attendant vulnerability was at least one central reason for the mistreatment. Zavaleta-Policiano, 873 F.3d at 247. Indeed, the evidence and testimony in this case establish that the abused suffered goes beyond a simple case of gender-based mistreatment within a personal relationship. See Velasquez v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 188, 195 (4th Cir. 207). AAs discussed above, there is a belief in Honduras that a man can “do anything” he wants toa women; thus, “[bJecause of his machismo,” he will willfully carry out horrific acts of abuse— on account of the fact that the victim is a Honduran woman is therefore largely helpless. Ex. 5, Tab M at 364. This gendered motivation is present gqgagmand his associates’ pursuit of amu, In fact, MENON credibly testified that law enforcement informed her thatalamge had engaged in such abuse before, revealing his awareness that he could harm Honduran women with impunity on account of the cultural gender bias in Honduran society. Ex, 2, Tab B at 15. Of course, this awareness was not at all misguided; indeed, the government took no action against dag, and he and his associates continued to pursue dias. Moreover, the language damm used when speaking todslasimitial evinces his gender-based motive and recognition of her perceived inferior status, repeatedly referring to her possessively and as a “bitch,” as well as asserting that he could mistreat her without punishment. Jd, at 13-15. Importantly, he also told her he could “profit” off her, again suggesting he targeted her because of her identity as a woman. It could be argued that dieeimtoen’ ras targeted in order to enrich the Canahuati criminal enterprise, but her status as a Honduran woman is inextricably intertwined with any such motive, as the record clearly shows that, under Acosta, “to the exten that the petitioner in this case suggests that she would be persecuted or has a well- founded fear that she would be persecuted in Iran simply because she is a woman,” she has articulated a cognizable particular social group. 12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993). This Court is aware of no precedential opinion of the Board or of any circuit court holding that a group made up of all the women in a given country cannot bea particular social group. Page 13 of 16 ‘ that her sex was a crucial factor in daags's and his associates’ decision to pursue her. Zavaleta- Policiano, 873 F.3d at 247. Based on the foregoing, the record clearly corroborates the notion that Wettmend his associates pursued dasamsa because of her identity, as it demonstrates that women in Honduras are widely subject to unpunishable mistreatment due to their subordination to men. See, ¢.g., Ex. 5, Tab M at 263, 276, 278, 345-47, 362, 364, 404-05, As such, the Court finds that Masiiiml has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one central reason $4 and his criminal associates targeted her, rather than another person, is that she is Honduran woman. Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 949-50. Therefore, the Court concludes that she has demonstrated the requisite nexus. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(). 2, Rebuttable Presumption of Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Because dimiwtwnl has demonstrated that she suffered past persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, she benefits from a rebuttable presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 CFR. § 1208.13(6)(1). DHS bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that, infer alia, there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that she no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in Honduras on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b\\1)@(A)-(B). DHS argues thatelaaga's death is a fundamental change in circumstances that rebuts the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Itis true thatslmmge, one of the aggressors ‘who pursued, has died. Ex, 5, Tab L at 238-43. However, the record shows that multiple criminal associates affiliated withdamg and his family likewise pursuede@mimiim, Indeed, dmg informedestanmitims that “his family has orders to kill” her and his bodyguards were searching for her. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14-15, She also credibly explained that his family is well connected and powerful. Ex. 5, Tab I at 222. qqmgp threateningly assétted that he had “a lot of friends in the police” and that his boss, a high-ranking drug trafficker, would target @aWimillmi, Ex. 5, Tab I at 221-22; Ex. 2, Tab B at 14-15. His associates also made their presence known in the lives of eM: family. For example, suspicious cars and a motorcycle frequently drove by Samia home, Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. Importantly, moreover, amma sister has received numerous threatening phone calls from “various numbers,” as well as text messages. See Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. In fact, only two months prior to the individual hearing in this matter, iii sister received text messages that menacingly claimed that ddasimiaimd would soon return to Honduras, Similarly, ‘men recently approached gjmsiminimiis mother at her ‘business to inquire about dimtmiaienite whereabouts, asserting they will find Qigsiwtdmb because they have numerous “contacts” in Honduras. Ex. 2, Tab B at 15. Therefore, even thoughslage is deadgiimnimil would face abuse at the hands oféamgaigefamily and criminal associates if she were retumed to Honduras. As such, the Court finds DHS has not met its burden to prove a fundamental change in circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 3. Humanitarian Asylum In the alternative, the Court grantsqhiassmiimigs asylum application due to the severity of the past persecution she suffered. Even where an applicant might not be able to establish a well- Page 14 of 16 ——_—_—————— founded fear of future persecution, ifshe has established particularly severe past persecution, then 2 court may grant asylum in an exercise of its discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii\\(A); Matter of Chen, 20 1&N Dec. 16, 21 (BIA 1989). Under Fourth Circuit precedent, “[e]ligibility for asylum based on severity of persecution alone is reserved for the most atrocious abuse,” Naizgi v, Gonzales, 455 F.3d 484 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Gonahasa v. INS, 181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir-1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 1066, 1072 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that rape may constitute atrocious abuse to support a grant of humanitarian asylum). Thus, a court may only grant humanitarian asylum when the past persecution was “so severe that it would be inhumane to return the [applicant] even in the absence of any risk of future persecution.” Gonahasa, 181 F.3d at 544 (quoting Vaduva v, INS, 131 F.3d 689, 690 (7th Cir. 1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted), ‘The Court finds that@@WA@MIBH has established past persecution so severe that she merits a gant of humanitarian asylum, 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii)(A). The record reflects that she was kidnapped, violently raped, and brutally beaten multipte times. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; Garcia- Martinez, 371 F.3d at 1072. On at least one occasion, other people watched while she was raped. ‘The beatings to which she was subjected left her bruised and bloodied. She was cut multiple times on her arm, leg, and back. Following this abuse, she, S09 and@lagumm were threatened with death several times. Ex. 2, Tab B at 14; see also Ex. 5, Tab Lat 221. When @9am-WN@al attempted to escape harm, her aggressors incessantly pursued her. Ex. 5, Tab I at 221. As a result of this repeated, prolonged abuse, @Aa™RGM suffers from severe emotional trauma. Jd She has twice attempted to commit suicide. She is constantly reminded of attacks she endured due to the scars left on her body. The Court observed her demeanor dufing the individual hearing and does not doubt that she suffered extreme, inhumane mistreatment that permanently affected her life. The severity of the abuse dimtiaiasl suffered is largely unparalleled by the harm discussed in Fourth Circuit decisions addressing requests for humanitarian asylum. In Naizgi, for example, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Board’s denial of humanitarian asylum, concurring that harm in the form of expatriation as well as the loss of livelihood and property was insufficient to warrant agrant of humanitarian asylum, 455 F.3d at 487. The atrocious abuse that iliaiméexperienced, resulting in her enduring trauma, is certainly more deplorable and depraved than the terrible mistreatment the petitioner in Naizgi suffered. Again, she was sequestered and repeatedly raped and beaten, resulting in lasting physical and emotional damage. Therefore, the Court concludes that this is such a case where the past persecution was so severe that it would be inhumane to remove @dauimiia to Honduras, even if there were an absence of a risk of future persecution, Gonahasa, 181 F.3d at 544, As such, the Court grants SIMgRiimis request for,humanitarian asylum in the altemative. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii)(A). IV. CONCLUSION ‘The Court concludes that dsimimaimiahas shown she faced past persecution on account of protected ground and, thus, benefits from the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution on the same basis. DHS has not rebutted that presumption. Therefore, the Court will Page 15 of 16 ————_—_— grant her application for asylum in an exercise of its discretion.” Alternatively, the Court finds that she warrants a grant of humanitarian asylum based on the severity of the past harm she experienced. As such, the Court also grants &S9NNHP8 derivative application for asylum, Accordingly, the Court enters the following order: t ORDERS It Is Ordered that: $e opp lication for asylum be GRANTED.

Kel APPEAL RIGHTS: Both parties have the right to appeal the decision in this case, Any appeal is due at the Board of Immigration Appeals on or before thirty (30) calendar days from the date of service of this decision. 2 Once an applicant has shown her statutory eligibility for asylum, a court must consider whether to grant or deny asylum in its discretion. 8 CFR. § 1208.14(@). The Fourth Circuit has recognized that discretionary denials of asylum are “exceedingly rare™ and require “egregious negative activity by the applicant.” Zvh .

Statement of the Case ‘On August 24, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (the Department) placed the Respondents into removal proceedings through the filing of Notices to Appear.! Exhs. 1, The Department alleged that the Respondents are natives and citizens of Honduras (not the United States) who entered the United States on May 24,2016 without a valid entry document and was not then inspected by an Immigration Officer. Jd. Based on the foregoing allegations, the Department charged the Respondents with removability pursuant to Section 212(a)(7)(A)G)(D of the Act, Jd. In Written Pleadings, filed on August 31, 2017, the Respondents admitted the allegations contained in the Notices to Appear and conceded the charges of removability, Exh. 2. Therefore, removability is established by clear and convincing evidence. See § 240(c)(3) of the Act; see also Woodby v.

It Testimony ‘The Lead Respondent testified that she entered the United States because she feared that her partner, CTT wanted to harm her and kill her. She lived with her partner from 2008 until 2016. Her family did not approve of the relationship, but she lived with him anyway. During the entirety of her relationship with her partner, he treated her “very bad” and called her names, such as “stupid,” “idiot,” and “son of a bitch.” She said that he always hit her. She recalled the first instance of abuse occurred when they were living together and her partner ‘was angry that she was not home when he arrives. She was at her mother’s house and subsequently, her partner followed her and yelled at her. He asked her if the people at her mother’s house were her lovers and questioned why she had gone there without his permission. Whenever she left the house, she was required to ask her partner for permission to do so. When they returned home, he called her stupid, grabbed her by the neck, threw her against the door, and hit her. She noted that this caused her to have many bruises and she was unable to see her family for two weeks. The Lead Respondent's partner was bothered by minor things. For example, he would get angry if he disliked the food that she cooked, if she did not clean his shoes correctly, or if she did not properly clean the floors. He also was very possessive. Although the Lead Respondent and her partner each had cellphones, he would use her cellphone because he wanted to control her. She added that he would search her phone and if he found something that he did not like that he ‘would insult her and hit her. He often called her “an idiot,” “trash,” or “bitch.” The Lead Respondent's partner was violent during her pregnancy. She testified that he ‘would always push her. She recalled that when ske was approximately six or seven months pregnant he grabbed her hands, pushed her against the door, and caused her to fall. Another instance of abuse occurred soon after she had a cesarean and was in recovery. The Lead Respondent said that she asked her partner to help her with their son because he was very little and she was still recovering, However, her partner got very upset that she was complaining. As a result, he yelled at her, grabbed her hands, and pushed her. He, again, called her “stupid” and “son of a bitch.” She explained that it was during this time that she realized that her partner was cheating on her with her cousin. ‘The Lead Respondent's partner forced her to have sex with him even when she refused. ‘She explained that he raped her. She believed that he abused her because she was a woman. She did not leave him after the rape or earlier because he had threatened to kill her. He would take their son away and lock her in a room. She was unable to leave because he would take the keys with him. ‘The Lead Respondent testified that she did not call the police about the abuse she experienced because partner abuse is normal in Honduras. Specifically, it is normal for men to hit their female partners. She added that the police tell victims of domestic abuse that it is a family problem and that they cannot do anything about it. ‘The Lead Respondent testified that she was not the only woman in Honduras who was mistreated or abused. She noted that her mother, sisters, female cousins, and female neighbors experienced similar abuse by their partners. She heard her father call her mother names. Her father’s abuse against her mother did not stop until he died. She also heard her sister's husband and her cousins’ husbands call them names. She knew this because she overheard the abuse and lived with her sister for some time. In particular, the Lead Respondent recalled that her cousin, ‘WED. was physically abused by her partner. Her cousin called the police, but they did not do anything. Her cousin had to flee to the United States to avoid further abuse. The Lead Respondents sister, was also hit by her husband, but she did not call the police because she knew that the police did not help her cousin in a similar situation. ‘The Lead Respondent said that her partner also abused his ex-partner MM. His ex- partner called the police and reported that he had hit her, but they did not help her. He was detained, but then released within twenty-four hcurs. After he was released, he hit his ex-partner again. When the Lead Respondent asked his ex-partner to provide a statement, she refused to do so because she was fearful that he would kill her as she still lives in Honduras. The Lead Respondent is unaware if her partner continued to hit his ex-partner after the Lead Respondent began a relationship with him. Prior to departing from Honduras, the Lead Respondent did not try to obtain a protective order because she knew that his ex-partner had previously requested one with no avail. After she left Honduras, her partner attempted to contact her by calling her cellphone. She thinks that either a friend or relative gave him her phone number. She testified that in October 2017, he sent her text messages asking about her location and questioning why he could not see her location. She believed that he still wanted to control her, so she blocked his phone number. ‘The Lead Respondent does not believe that she could live elsewhere in Honduras and feel safe. She noted that Honduras is a small country and that the police cannot protect her. The Lead Respondent fears that if she returns to Honduras that her partner will look for her and kill her. In regards to her asylum interview on May 24, 2016, at the Kames Detention Center, the Lead Respondent did not know what to say. She remembers stating that she equally feared gangs and her partner. However, the reason why she left Honduras was because of her partner’s mistreatment. She confirmed that she said that her partner had emotionally harmed her. She noted that she was very emotional during the interview because it was not easy for her to talk about the abuse. She does not remember saying that her partner did not harm her. The Lead Respondent reiterated that she was unsure what she said because she was very emotional, as it ‘was her first time out of her country and she had been separated from her son, but whatever she said during the interview she knows that she came to the United States because her partner physically abused her. She also testified that the asylum officer at the border mistreated her and cursed at her. IV. Statement of the Law A. Credibility ‘The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended various sections of the Act relating to relief from removal. Pub. L, No, 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat, 231 (2005). Specifically, the Act was amended to include § 240(c)(4)(B), which provides that in order for an applicant for relief from removal to sustain her burden of establishing eligibility for such relief, she must “comply with the applicable requirements to submit information or documentation” in support of such application. Further, the Court must determine whether testimonial evidence “is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts” sufficient to satisfy the applicant's burden of proof, and weigh such evidence with other evidence in the record. Id. Uneorroborated testimony that is credible, persuasive, and specific may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof. See § 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a). However, where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts, such evidence should be provided as long as the applicant has the evidence or can reasonably obtain it. Cf Matter of S-M-J-, 21 T&N Dec. 722, 725 (BIA 1997). The absence of such corroboration may lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof. Jd. at 725-26. Nonetheless, the immigration judge must provide ‘he applicant an opportunity to explain the lack of corroborating evidence and ensure that the applicant's explanation is included in the record. See id. Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 182, 192 (4th Cir. 2007). The Board has made clear that applicants cannot meet their burden of proof by “general and vague” testimony, and “the weaker an [applicant's] testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.” Matter of Y-B-,21 I&N Dee. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998). B, Asylum ‘An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that she meets the definition of a refugee under Section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. Under this Section, a refugee is defined, in part, as an individual who is unable or unwilling to retumn to her home country because of persecution, or a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486, 489 (BIA 1996); 8.CER. § 1208.13(a); § 208(6)(1)(B) of the Act. The applicant's fear of persecution must be country-wide. Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dee. 211, 235 (BIA 1985); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3). Additionally, the applicant must establish that she is unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country of nationality or last habitual residence. § 101(a)(42)(A) ofthe Act. An applicant who establishes statutory eligibility for asylum still bears the burden of demonstrating that she merits a grant of asylum as a matter of discretion. § 208(b)(1) of the Act; see also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987) In order to establish a claim for either asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant ‘must demonstrate that the harm she fears constitutes persecution under the Act. § 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. The Board has interpreted “persecution” to include serious threats to an individual's life or freedom, or the infliction of significant harm on the applicant, as a means of punishing that person for holding a characteristic that the persecutor seeks to overcome. Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222- 23; but see Matter of A-E-M-, 21 I&N Dec. 1157, 1159 (BIA 1998) (harassment in the form of a painted threat on the respondent's house is insufficient to establish persecution); see also Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 P.3d 944 (4th Cir. 2015) (serious death threats constitute persecution). To establish past persecution, the applicant must demonstrate that she suffered persecution in her country of nationality on account of an actual or imputed protected ground, and that she is unable or unwilling to return to, or avail herself of the protection of that country ‘because of such persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). Not every act of discrimination or harassment rises to the level of persecution, as persecution is “an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive.” Li v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, cumulative incidents in the aggregate may rise to the level of persecution. See Baharon v. Holder, 588 F.3d 228, 232-33 (4th Cir. 2009); see also Matter of O-Z- & -Z-, 22 I&N Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998). When the alleged persecutor is a private actor, the applicant also bears the burden of showing that her “home government was ‘unable or unwilling to control” her persecutors. Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 330 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 224 & n.8 (BIA 2014)); see also Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 953 (holding that applicant's credible belief that police would not have taken action on her reports against gang, members, paired with country conditions reflecting police ineffectiveness and corruption, established that Salvadoran authorities were unable or unwilling to protect her). If an applicant demonstrates past persecution on account of a protected ground, she will benefit from a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1). This presumption can be rebutted only if “{t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution” or the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to a different region of that country and it ‘would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(); see also Naizgi v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 484 (4th Cir. 2006). An applicant who fails to present a credible basis for a claim of past persecution may nevertheless prevail on a theory of future persecution. To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must establish both a subjective and an objective component. See Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 126 (4th Cir, 2011). Credible testimony by an applicant may be enough to satisfy the subjective component. Once a subjective fear of persecutioa is established, the applicant need only show that such fear is objectively reasonable; that is, she must present credible, specific, and detailed evidence that a reasonable person in her position would fear persecution. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dee. at 224-25. The applicant’s fear may be well-founded even if there is only a one in ten chance of persecution. Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126 (citing Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 US. at 431). An applicant for asylum must also demonstrate that the persecution she fears would be inflicted “on account of” her race, religion, natiorality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F-R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(A). Even treatment that is regarded as “morally reprehensible” is not “persecution” within the meaning of the Act unless it occurs “on account 21 I&N Dec. 775, 777 (BIA 1997). In essence, the applicant must demonstrate that her race, religion, nationality, particular social of” one of the five enumerated grounds. Matter of T-M- group, or political opinion would be “at least one central reason” for the persecutor’s actions against her. § 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act; INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992). Membership in a particular social group is one of the five enumerated grounds upon which an applicant may base her claim for asylum or withholding of removal. 8 CFR. §§ 1208.13(b), 1208.16(b). ‘To demonstrate persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, an applicant must establish that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 320, 330-31 (citing Matter of M-E- V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014) and Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dee. at 208); see also Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 212. ‘The group must exist “independently of the alleged underlying harm.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I8N Dec. at 317. The shared characteristic “must be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because itis. fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 231 (internal quotation marks omitted), The common characteristic may be as innate as sex, color, or kinship ties, or as subtle as a shared past experience, and will be determined on a case~ by-case basis. See id. at 251; see also Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. at 233. The “particularity” requirement concerns the boundaries of the propesed social group, while the “social distinction” requirement demands that the members of the proposed social group are significantly set apart from others within the community in question. See Matter of A-B-, 27 18N Dec. at 330; Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238; see also Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 214, 216-17. ‘The Attorney General recently issued a decision providing a framework for analysis for asylum claims for victims of domestic violence by private actors.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dee. at316, In that matter, the Attorney General stated that “there may be exceptional circumstances when victims of private criminal activity could” establish eligibility for asylum. Jd, at 317. The ‘Attorney General in particular decried the fact that in that case, the parties and the Board had not performed the necessary legal and factual analysis.” Jd at 319. He also decried the “insufficient deference to the factual findings of the immigration judge,” because the particular social group in that case based on Matter of A-R-C-G- had largely been uncontested by the parties. Id, at 319-20, 340; Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 1&N Dec. 338 (BIA 2014). The Attomey General reiterated the requirements for showing a particular social group, and emphasized that the particular social group must exist independently of the harm asserted for the asylum application. Jd. at 327-331, 334, In addition, the Attorney General noted that the mere fact that a country has problems policing certain crimes or that certain populations are more vulnerable to crimes cannot establish an asylum claim. Id. at 320. ‘The Court is bound by the Attomey General’s decision, except to the extent that itis superseded or supplemented by Fourth Circuit case law. ‘The Fourth Circuit has a particularly rich body of jurisprudence on the issue of particu‘ar social groups and other areas of asylum law. See, e.g., Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d. at 117 (family is the “prototypical example” of a particular social group); Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 944 (nuclear family as a particular social group); Cordova v. Holder, 759 F.3d 332 (4th Cir. 2014); Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122 (4th Cir. 2017). C. Withholding of Removal Pursuant to § 241(b)(3) of the Act To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that her “life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” § 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act. Specifically, the applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that she will be subject to persecution if retumed to the country from which she seeks protection. 8 CFR. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i); see also INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 2 While Matter of A-B- provides analytical framework, there is nothing in the decision that appears to be new law. In fact, tis is the position that the government took before the federal district court in Grace ef al. v. Whitaker, No. 18- CV 01853 (US. District Court for D.C., Dec. 19, 2018). See eg, slip op at 60. 10 U.S. at 423. An applicant who fails to demonstrate the well-founded fear of persecution required for asylum will necessarily fail to meet the higher burden of proof required for withholding of removal. See Mirisawo v. Holder, $99 F.3d 391, 396 (4th Cir. 2010); Camara, 378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir. 2004). D, Relief under the Torture Convention To be protected under Article 3 of the Torure Convention, an applicant must establish that itis “more likely than not that [she] would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.” 8 CF.R. § 1208.16(¢)(2). “Torture” is defined, in part, as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering by a public official, at the instigation of a public official, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). The severe pain or suffering must be inflicted on the applicant or a third person for such purposes as: (1) “obtaining... information or a confession,” (2) “punishing... for an act... committed or... suspected of having committed,” (3) intimidation or coercion, or (4) “for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.” Id. The Board has specified that only “extreme forms] of cruel and inhuman treatment” rise to the level of torture. Matter of J-E-, 23 T&N Dec. 291, 297-99 (BIA 2002) (noting that mental pain or suffering may also constitute torture if it falls within the regulatory definition at 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(4)). In order to constitute torture, mental pain or suffering must be prolonged. 8 CFR. § 1208.18(a)(4). It also must be caused by or resulting from intentional pain or suffering, threatened or actual administration or application of mind altering substances or similar procedures, or threatened imminent death. Id. These causes or results can be directed towards the applicant or another person. Id. In addition, before an applicant will qualify for protection under the Torture Convention, “specific grounds must exist that indicate [she] would be personally at risk.” Matter of $-V-, 22 T&N Dec. 1306, 1313 (BIA 2000), Where an applicant fears torture from multiple entities, she ‘must show that the cumulative probability of torture exceeds fifty percent, Rodriguez-Arias ¥. Whitaker, No. 17-211, 2019 WL 542996, at *3 (4th Cir. Feb. 12, 2019). V. Findings ‘The Court has considered the arguments cf both parties and the entire record carefully. All evidence and testimony has been considered, even if not addressed in the decision. u A. Credibility ‘The Lead Respondent's testimony was credible overall. Her testimony generally was internally consistent and consistent with her asylum application and affidavit. Exh. 3, Tab A; Exh. 4, Tab A. She also submitted statements from her mother, friend, and neighbors to corroborate her claim. See Exh. 4, Tabs C2-C5. She testified cleatly and consistently about when her partner emotionally and physically abused her. Her demeanor was appropriate to her testimony, She became very tearful when discussing the sexual and physical abuse. Further, a psychological evaluation conducted of the Lead Respondent determined that “it is highly unlikely that she is malingering or exaggerating symptoms.” Exh. 4, Tab C6 at 31. ‘The Department confronted the Lead Respondent regarding some minor inconsistencies between her testimony and her Credible Fear inte-view, but these were not harmful to her credibility. The Department’s attorney asked the Lead Respondent if she remembered stating to an asylum officer that she feared gangs in Honduras. The Lead Respondent affirmed that she did fear gangs. She added that she also told the asylum officer that she feared her partner. The Department alleged that the Lead Respondent told the asylum officer that her partner did not physically harm her. The Lead Respondent said that she did not remember that. She further explained that she was very emotional when she entered the United States and was unsure what, she said because it was difficult for her to speak about the abuse. She also was confused and disoriented because it was her first time out of he: country and she had been separated from her child. Regardless, the Department has not introduced the Credible Fear form into evidence for the Court to properly determine whether there were actually inconsistencies that would be harmful to the Lead Respondent’s credibility. Thus, while the Court certainly would give the Credible Fear interview weight under the appropriate circumstances since it is designed to elicit, the basics of an asylum claim, since the Department did not submit it into evidence the Court cannot give it any weight. ‘The Lead Respondent did not embellish about the extent of the harm caused by her partner nor the injuries that resulted from those incidents of abuse. For example, when asked whether her partner abused her, the Lead Respondent, without hesitation, stated that he repeatedly called her derogatory names and hit her. Additionally, she was honest and straightforward when discussing whether she reported her partner's abuse to the police, All of 12 these factors and the Lead Respondent’s candid demeanor throughout her testimony supports a finding that she is credible. B. Asylum 1, Persecution ‘The Lead Respondent was subjected to harm sufficiently severe to constitute persecution. ‘The Lead Respondent testified that her partner sexually abused her. Due to the control that he exerted over the Lead Respondent, he was able to rape her. The sexual abuse that the Lead Respondent experienced alone qualifies as persecution. Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 362 (BIA 1996) (indicating that rape, sexual abuse, and domestic violence may serve as evidence of past persecution); Angoucheva v, INS, 106 F.34 781 (7th Cir. 1997); Shoaféra v. INS, 228 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir. 2000); Zubeda v. Ashcroft, 333 F-3d 463 (3d. Cir. 2003) (recognizing that “rape and sexual violence may constitute sufficient persecution”); Uwais v. United States Ait'y Gen., 478 F.3d 513, 518 (2d. Cir. 2007) (finding that sexual assault and rape may constitute past persecution). ‘The Lead Respondent's partner also physically and verbally abused her on numerous occasions when he hit her and called her “daughter of sixty thousand bitches,” “son of a bitch,” “bitch,” and “stupid.” Exh. 4, Tab A at 1-3, Exh. 4, Tab C1. Consequently, while in Honduras, the Lead Respondent experienced “sufficient symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD” resulting from the abuse by her partner. Exh. 4, Tab C6 at31. Her partner repeatedly threatened to kill her if she left him. Exh. 4, Tab A at 1-3. The death threats to the Lead Respondent’s life also qualifies as persecution. See Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126 (citing Li, 405 F.3d at 177). Inthe aggregate, the sexual abuse, the deata threats, and other serious abuse the Lead Respondent has suffered undoubtedly rise to the level of persecution, Li, 405 F.3d at 177; Hernandez-Avalos, 784 F.3d at 944, 2. Protected Ground - Particular Social Group The Lead Respondent purports that she suffered past persecution on account of her membership in a particular social groups defined as “women in Honduras,” “women in Honduras who are unable to leave their relationship,” and “Honduran woman viewed as property because of their position in a familial relationship.”"

,"commit the fraud that was committed by the respondent in Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467. She did pass through other countries but her stays there were short. It is true that she made no attempt to seck asylum or other residency in the countries though which she passed. However, 28 most importantly, the Board noted in Pula, that “the danger of persecution should generally outweigh all but the most egregious of adverse factors.” Matter of Pula, 19 18N Dec. 467, 474, This is a very strong positive discretionary factor in the Lead Respondent's case. In this matter, the strong positive discretionary factors of the danger of persecution if she were to return to Honduras outweigh the negative factors in her migration and immigration history. C. Relief of Withholding of Removal Under § 241(b)(3) of the Act and Under the Convention Against Torture Since the Lead Respondent has established eligibility for asylum, it is not necessary to reach the merits of her claim for relief of withholding under section 241(b)(3) of the Act ot pursuant to the Torture Convention, as asylum isa greater benefit which obviates the necessity of relief pursuant to the Torture Convention, See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (noting that “courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”). VI. Conclusion The Lead Respondent's testimony is credible. Based on her testimony and extensive information about country conditions, the Lead Respondent has established that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground of Honduran women in domestic relationships. 26 Accordingly, the Respondent has met her burden for purposes of asylum under the Act. In light of the foregoing, the following order is entered: ORDER Itis hereby ordered that: Lead Respondent’s application for Asylum under Section 208 of the Act is GRANTED. Minor Respondent is also GRANTED asylum as a derivative. FHF Date Denise Noonan Slavin United States Immigration Judge Baltimore, Maryland Appeal Due: 22°! 7 27"
IJ decision Brazilian National (9th Cir.),"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW FLORENCE IMMIGRATION COURT 3260 NORTH PINAL PARKWAY FLORENCE, ARIZONA 85132 IN THE MATTER OF: IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS Ea FileNo. ar. aaa CHARGE: INA §212€@)(7A))) APPLICATIONS: Asylum pursuant to INA § 208 Withholding of Removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) Protection under the Convention Against Torture FOR THE DEPARTMENT: Telitey Lindsay, Esquire Assistant Chief Counsel Department of Homeland Security 3250 North Pinal Parkway Florence, Arizona 85132 EOR RESPONDENT: ;MORANDUM ORDER AND DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATI URT 1 PROCEDURAL HISTORY Respondent is a twenty-six-yeat-old native and citizen of Brazil. (Ex. 1, Form I-862; see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) On January 21, 2019, the Department of Homeland Seourity (“DHS” or “Department’) served Respondent with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), alleging: 1. You are not a citizen or national of the United States; 2. Youare a native of Brazil and a citizen of Brazil; 3. On or about January 21, 2019, you applied for admission into the United States from Mexico at the DeConcini Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona; 4, Youare an immigrant not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing card, or other valid entry document required by the Immigration and Nationality Act. (Id.) Based on these allegations, DHS charged Respondent as subject to removal from the United States pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), as an alien who, at the time of application for admission, was not in possession of a valid entry document. Id. On January 28, 2019, DHS filed the NTA with the Florence Immigration Court, which initiated . SS 7 [ Temoval proceedings against Respondent and vested this Court with; \\jurisdiction. (See id; see also 8 CER. § 1003.14(@).) At a hearing on February 4, 2019, Respondent admitted the factual allegations set forth in the NTA, conceded removability, and declined to designate a country of removal. (Hi’g (Feb. 4, 2019).) Based on Respondent's admissions and concession, the Court sustained the charge of Temovability under INA § 212(a)(7)(a)(i)(D), and directed Brazil as the country of removal. See INA § 240(0)(1)(A); see also 8 CFR. § 1240.10(c). On March 21, 2019, Respondent filed a Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, with the Court, thereby applying for asylum under INA § 208, withholding of removal under INA § 241(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). (Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) Respondent testified in support of his Form 1-589 at an individual hearing on May 3, 2019. I. REMOVABILITY Ata hearing on February 4, 2019, Respondent admitted the four factual allegations set forth in the NTA. Specifically, Respondent admitted that he is a native and citizen of Brazil, and that he is not a citizen of the United States. Respondent also admitted that he last arrived in the United States on or about January 21, 2019, and that he was not then in possession of a valid entry document required by the Act. Based on the evidence of record, including Respondent's admissions, the Court finds that clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence supports a finding that Respondent is subject to removal pursuant to INA § 212(a)(7)(A)((D). Thus, the Court sustains the sole charge of removability IM. EVIDENTIARY RECORD In reviewing Respondent's applications for relief, all admitted evidence and testimony was considered in its entirety, regardless of whether specifically referenced in the text of this decision. The admitted evidence and testimony is incorporated as part of the factual basis and substantial evidence upon which this Court bases this instant decision. ‘During the course of the proceedings, the Court admitted the following exhibits into the record: Exhibit 1: Notice to Appear, Form I-862 (dated January 21, 2019) Exhibit2: Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, Form 1-889 Exhibit 3: DHS Exhibit List for Evidentiary Hearing (Tabs A-D) Exhibit4: Respondent's Documents in Support of Hearing (received April 23, 2019) In addition to the documentary evidence contained in the record, the Court also considered Respondent's testimony before the Court on May 3, 2019. IV. _ BURDEN OF PROOF AND CREDIBILITY ‘The alien bears the burden to establish that he is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See INA § 240(c)(4)(A).. If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such a _ =—_— ( grounds do not apply. See 8 CER. § 1240.8(4); see also Matter of M-B-C-, 27 1&N Dec. 31 (BIA 2017). To determine if the respondent has met his burden, the Court will assess whether his testimony is credible, persuasive, and fact-specific. See INA § 240(c)(4XB). In applying a “totality of the circumstances” approach, the Court assesses: the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements .,. the intemal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inecuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, ‘or any other relevant factor. INA § 240(¢)(4\\(C). There is no presumption of credibility. Jd When the Court deems it necessary, corroborating evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the ‘evidence and cannot reasonably obtain it. See Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 724-26 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 518 (BIA 2015). Furthermore, any minor inconsistencies or incidental misstatements that do “not go to the heart of an applicant's claim does not support an adverse credibility determination.” Li v. Holder, 559 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir. 2011). Upon review of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds Respondent credible, Notably, the Court finds that Respondent's testimony was detailed, consistent, and specific. In particular, Respondent's account of the numerous threats he received was consistent with Respondent's prior submitted written statement in his 1-589 application. (See Hr'g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) Furthermore, Respondent thoroughly explained the discrepancies between his written declaration and his in-court testimony. ‘As Respondent's testimony was credible, persuasive, and fact-specific, he has met his burden of proof and persuasion in connection with his claim and need not corroborate it further. See INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(D; 8 C-F.R. § 1208.13; see also Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439, 445 (BIA 1987). Although the Court finds Respondent's testimony to be credible without corroboration, the Court notes that Respondent submitted documents and articles to further support his claim. (See Ex. 4, Resp't Docs. in Support of Hr’g.) The Court also acknowledges that at Respondent's heating on May 3, 2019, DHS Counsel (“Counsel”) inquired as to several aspects of Respondent's testimony. ‘The Court addresses these inquiries below. ‘Counsel first cross-examined Respondent regarding the police report he filed following the third threat when two men showed up at his home in Ipaba. Counsel asked Respondent why the gun brandished by the men during the threat was not mentioned in the police report. (See Ex. 4; Resp't Docs. in Support of Hr’g, Civil Police Report.) Respondent explained that he told the policeman about the gun, but the police were not willing to help him, and they detailed what they wanted to ‘mention in the report. In addition, Respondent said that he believes the police are paid by the Brazilian government who is attempting to harm both Respondent and the Movimiento Sen Terra, or Movement without Earth (“MST”) Party. As such, Respondent stated that it would not be 3 oO (Cc — ‘harmful for the police to write all the details about the car included in the report, but it would be harmful for them to mention the gun. Counsel also questioned Respondent regarding the actions of the MST Party. During his testimony, Respondent stated that the MST Party assists the poor with acquiring land in Brazil. (Hr’g (May 3, 2019),) However, Counsel pointed out that in documents submitted by Respondent, 4 report calls into question whether the actions of the Party are legal. Respondent stated that he ‘was not exactly sure how land was taken ot given away. Respondent said his role was simply to Pass out pamphlets with information about the Party, and it was simple work, Though some of Respondent's past recollections of events during his in-court testimony were slightly inconsistent with other evidence of record, Respondent explained the discrepancies to the satisfaction of the Court. Because Respondent's testimony was detailed, consistent, and plausible, the Court finds, based on the totality of circumstances, that Respondent is credible, See INA § 240(0)(4)(Q)s see also J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. at 265. As Respondent's testimony was credible, the Court finds that he met his burden of proof and persuasion in connection with his application for relief and need not corroborate his claim further. See INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(); 8 CER. § 1208.13; Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 445. V. ASYLUM To qualify for asylum, the alien must establish that: (1) his application was filed timely within one year of his last arrival in the United States; (2) he is not statutorily barred from relief; (3) he is a refugee within the meaning of INA § 101(a)(42)(A); and (4) he merits asylum as a matter of discretion. INA § 208(b)(1)-(2); Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 218-19 (BIA 1985), modified on other grounds by Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. at 446; 8 CF.R. § 1208.13(a). Here, Respondent timely filed his application: he last arrived in the United States on or about January 21, 2019, and filed his Form 1-589 on March 21, 2019. (See Ex. 1, Form 1-862; see also Ex, 2, Form 1-589.) Moreover, DHS does not allege, and the Court has not found, that any of the statutory bars to relief apply. See INA § 208(b)(2)(A). ‘Thus, the only issues before the Court are whether Respondent is a “refugee” within the meaning of the INA and whether he merits relief as a matter of diseretion. A. “Refugee” as Defined under INA § 101(a)(42)(A) Attespondent may qualify as a refugee because he has suffered past persecution or because he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Sce 8 CFR. § 1208.13(6)(1). If the respondent establishes past persecution, he shall be presumed to have a well-founded fear of future Persecution. See id That presumption may be rebutted if DHS proves by a preponderance of evidence that either: (1) there has been 2 fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution; or (2) the respondent could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his country of nationality or country of last habitual residence, and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to do so. See 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1){)(A)-(B). The respondent must also establish that the alleged persecution or ‘well-founded fear of persecution was or will be “on account of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in @ particular social group, or political opinion.” See INA §§ 101(a)(42\\(A), 208(b)(1(B)G). C c ———_—— i Past Persecution In order to establish past persecution, a respondent must show: (1) harm that rises to the level of persecution; (2) which was inflicted “on account of” one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and 3) was committed “by the government or forces the government is either ‘unable or unwilling’ to control.” See Navas v. INS, 217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir, 2000); see also Rahimzadeh v. Holder, 613 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 2010). For a respondent to establish that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground, the respondent must show proof of a nexus between the protected ground and the persecution suffered. See Smolniakova v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 1037, 1049-50 (9th Cir. 2005); Kebede » Ashcroft, 366 F.3d 808, 812 (9th Cir. 2004), To show proof of the required nexus, the respondent must demonstrate that the persecutors knew of the protected ground and persecuted him because of it. See Deloso v. Ashcroft, 393 F.3d 858, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Kebede, 366 F.3d.at 812. The respondent is not required to provide direct proof of his persecutor’s motives, but rather just provide “some evidence of it, direct or circumstantial.” INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992); Lopes v. Ashcroft, 366 F.3d 799, 804 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of N-Mc, 25 1&N Dec. 526, 529 (BIA 2011). However, the protected ground cannot be incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for the harm. Matter of S-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 486, 490 (BIA 1996), There is no universally accepted definition of “persecution.” The Board has defined “persecution” as “either a threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who <iffer in a way regarded as offensive.\"" Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 222. In addition, “persecution” under the Act “contemplates that harm or suffering must be inflicted upon an individual in order to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome.” Id. at 223. A respondent may be subjected to acts which individually would not amount to persecution; however, the combination of factors may establish persecution based on a cumulative ground. Jd at ] 52; see also Korabiina v. INS, 158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding persecution where Ukrainian Jew witnessed violent attacks, and suffered extortion, harassment, and threats by anti- Semitic ultra-nationalists). The court “look{s] at the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether a finding of persecution is compelled.” Guo v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding persecution where Chinese Christian was arrested, detained twice, physically abused, and forced to renounce religion); see, e.g., Vitug v. Holder, 723 F.3d 1056, 1065-66 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[N]Jo reasonable factfinder could conclude that the harm Vitug suffered did not tise to the level of persecution in light of the cumulative effect of multiple instances of physical harm and victimization, Thus, we presume that Vitug is eligible for withholding of removal relief”); see also Guo v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 1208, 1212 (9th Cir. 2018). Threats of serious harm, particularly when combined with confrontation, may constitute persecution. See, e.g. Mashiri v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 1112, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2004). Threats on an individual's life, “within a context of political and social turmoil or violence, have long been held sufficient.to satisfy a petitioner’s burden of showing an objective basis for fear of persecution.” Kaiser v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir. 2004). What is important “is whether the group making the threat has the will or the ability to carry it out.” Jd, Courts have also consistently held that being forced to flee from one’s home due to an immediate threat of either severe physical violence or death is within the definition of persecution, “as long as the persecutors’ actions are motivated by the victim’s race or some other protected consideration,” See Mendoza-Pablo v. Holder, 667 F.3d 1308, 1314 (9th Cir, 2012) (recognizing that being forced to flee home in face 5 Cc (0 = of immediate threat of violence or death may constitute persecution.); see also Knezevic v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Khup v, Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir. 2004). In addition, while unfulfilled threats are generally not enough to establish past persecution, an individual who has been threatened and “closely confronted” may suffer past persecution. See Ruano v. Ashcroft, 301 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir. 2002) (Individual who was “closely confronted” and actively chased by men he knew were armed suffered past persecution.) In the case at hand, Respondent credibly testified that he was threatened on three different instances. (Ex. 2, Form 1-589; see also Hr'g (May 3, 2019).) in the first incident, Respondent received anote under the gate to his home in Belo Horizonte. The note stated that both Respondent and his wife would lose their ives if he continued to participate in the MST Party, (Id.) After he received the threatening note, Respondent moved to Vitoria, Espirito Santo. (Jd) While in Espirito Santo, Respondent continued to attend MST Party meetings and events. (/d.) Respondent received his second threat by phone in 2018. (Jd.) An anonymous caller stated that if Respondent continued to help the MST Party, he was going to-lose his life. (Id) The caller also told Respondent that they knew his address, and his work license plate for his cab. (Jd) Following that threat, Respondent again moved to his in-law’s home in Ipaba with his pregnant wife. (Id) On January 2, 2019, two men showed up at the home. (Jd.) The men came out of acat, pointed a gun at Respondent and his wife, and stated that Respondent had a week to leave or he will die due to his support of the MST Party. (Ex. 2, Form 1-589, pg, 5.) ‘The medium of the threats against Respondent appear to be increasing in aggression, as a note turned into a phone call, and phone call tumed into a face-to-face confrontation in which Respondent was “closely confronted” with a weapon. See Khup, 376 F.3d at 903. In addition, Respondent was forced to flee his home with his wife on three separate occasions due to the threats against both Respondent and his wife’s lives. See Mendoza-Pablo, 667 F.3d at 1314, Furthermore, as Respondent stated in his testimony, he fears for his life and he believes the men will follow through on their threats as they have found him in three different Brazilian cities. (fd) Considering the persecutory acts in their totality, and viewing the cumulative effect of all the alleged acts, the Court finds that Respondent has established that he suffered past persecution in Brazil. See INA § 101(a)(42)(A); see also 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1). ii, Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution If.a respondent demonstrates past persecution on account of a protected ground, he will benefit from a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. See 8 CFR. § 1208.13(o)(1). However, even if past persecution is not found, a respondent may still be eligible for asylum due to a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 CF.R. § 1208.13(). Here, even if the Court finds that Respondent has not established past persecution in Brazil, the Court would still find that Respondent has established a well-founded fear of future persecution. A well-founded fear must be subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. See Parada v. ‘Sessions, 902 F.3d 901, 909 (9th Ciz, 2018). A “*well-founded fear’ ... can only be given concrete ‘meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448 (1987). A respondent can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if: (1) he has a fear of persecution in her countrys (2) there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution; and (3) he is unable or unwilling to retum to that country because of such fear. See 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)2)(i). a ie ce First, the subjective prong of the well-founded fear test is satisfied by a respondent’s credible testimony that he genuinely fears harm. See Parada, 902 F.3d at 909, Looking at Respondent’s testimony, he clearly testified that he genuinely fears harm in Brazil. (Hr’g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) Respondent stated that he is scared to be tortured both physically and mentally. (See Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) He also fears that he and his wife could be taken by surprise by the opposition members, especially after he was threatened at gunpoint. (Id.) Second, the objective prong of the test can be met in two different ways. One way is to “prove persecution in the past, giving rise to a rebuttable presumption that a well-founded fear exists.” Lada v. INS, 215 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2000) (intemal citations and quotation marks omitted), overruled on other grounds by Abebe v. Mukasey, 554 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). ‘The second way “is to show a good reason to fear fture persecution by adducing credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of fects that would support a reasonable fear of persecution.” Ja, This requirement can be met by either the production of specific documentary evidence, or by a respondent's credible and persuasive testimony.” Id. In addition, “[e]ven a ten percent chance of persecution may establish a well-founded fear.” Al-Harbi v. INS, 242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir, 2001). A respondent may demonstrate a well-founded fear by showing that he has been targeted for persecution. See, e.g., Marcos v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1112, 1119 (Sth Cir. 2005) (Philippine applicant demonstrated well-founded fear based on credible death threats by members of the New People’s Amy.) Here, Respondent can show at least “a ten percent chance of persecution.” l-Harbi, 242 F.3d at 888. Respondent endured three sets of threats that appear to be increasing in violence. (See Fir'g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) Furthermore, documents submitted by Respondent demonstrate that the MST Party is targeted by numerous Brazilian citizens, including supporters of the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. (See Ex. 4, Resp’t Docs, in Support of Hig, at Reportagem 02,) For example, one of the leaders of the MST Party was attacked by supporters of the President, (/d., at Reportages 03.) Respondent also submitted two news articles which reported the deaths of MST Party activists by armed men. (d., Land rights activist shot dead in Brazilian Amazon hospital, THE GUARDIAN, Mar. 21, 2018; Two Members of Brazil's MST Landless Movement Murdered, TELESUR ENGLISH, Dec. 9, 2018.) Finally, Respondent is unwilling or unable to return to Brazil. Respondent has expressed his fear of death or bodily injury if retumed to Brazil.. (See Hr’g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) Respondent stated that he feared torture or death due to the series of threats, especially the third threat with a weapon. (Jd) Respondent has established a well-founded fear of future persecution in Brazil. Respondent has shown both a subjective and objective fear of persecution in Brazil. In addition, Respondent has demonstrated that he is unwilling or unable to retum to Brazil. Thus, even if the Respondent has not demonstrated past persecution, the Court finds he is still eligible for asylum. 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b). ili, On Account of a Protected Ground In addition to demonstrating harm rising to the level of persecution, the respondent bears the burden of establishing that establish that “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular 7 ca =a Ga (CO social group, or political opinion was or will be a least one central reason for persecuting the” respondent. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)1)(B)4) (emphasis added), [A] motive is a “central reason” if the persecutor would not have harmed the applicant if such motive did not exist. Likewise, a motive is a “central reason” if that motive, standing alone, would have led the persecutor to harm the applicant. -- [Plersecution may be caused by more than one central reason, and an asylum, applicant need not prove which reason was dominant. Nevertheless, to demonstrate that a protected ground was “at least one central reason” for persecution, an applicant must prove that such ground was a cause of the persecutors” acts. Parussimova v. Mukasey, 555 F.3d 734, 741 (9th Cir. 2009); see also Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1062 (9th Cir, 2017) (en banc); Regalado-Escobar v, Holder, 717 F.3d 724, 732 (Sth Cir. 2013) (“Under the REAL ID Act, the applicant bears the burden to show nexus bby showing that a protected ground was “one central reason” for his persecution.”); Zetino v. Holder, 622 F.3d 1007, 1015 (9th Cir. 2010) (“The REAL ID Act of 2005 places an additional burden on Zetino to demonstrate that one of the five protected grounds will be at least one central reason for his persecution.”). In order to show that a respondent was persecuted “on account of” a political opinion, two requirements must be shown. First, arespondent must show that he held, or his persecutors believe he held, a political opinion. Navas, 217 F.3d at 656; see also Khudaverdyan v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1101, 1106 (Sth Cir. 2015). Second, the respondent must show that his persecutors persecuted hhim, or that he faces the prospect of such persecution, because of his political opinion. Navas, 217 F.3d at 646. In other words, that a respondent holds a political opinion “is not, by itself, enough to establish that any future persecution would be ‘on account’ of this opinion, He must establish that the political opinion would motivate his potential persecutors.” Njuguna v. Asherofi, 374 F.3d 765, 770 (9th Cir. 2004), A respondent may exhibit his political opinion by membership or participation in an organization with a political purpose or goals. See, e.g. Montoya-Ulloa v. INS, 79 F.3d 930, 931 (9th Cir. 1996) (membership in political group opposing the Sandinistas); see also Mendoza Perez v. INS, 902 F.2d 760 (Sth Cir. 1990) (involvement with Salvadoran land reform organization). In order to establish nexus, a respondent's uncontroverted credible testimony as to the persecutor’s motivations may be sufficient to establish nexus. See, e.g. Antonyan v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1250, 1254 (Sth Cir, 2011); see also Shoafera v. INS, 228 F.3d 1070,,1074-75 (9th Cir. 2000) (Ethiopian applicant established through her credible testimony and witness testimony that the perpetrator was motivated to rape her based, in part, on her Ambara ethnicity), Furthermore, direct proof of motivation may consist of evidence conceming statements made by the persecutor to the respondent, or by respondent to persecutor. See, e.g., Kebede, 366 F.3d at 812 (soldiers stated that Tepe was because of Kebede's family's position in prior Ethiopian regime); see also Duarte de Guinac, 179 F.3d at 1162 (noting that motivation was on account of ethnicity where persecution ‘was “coupled with explicit expressions of ethnic hatred’. Here, Respondent asserts that his political opinion was at least one central reason for his persecution. See, ¢.g., INA § 208(b)(1)(B)4); (See also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) In support of his Claim, he credibly testified that he was a member of the MST Party. (Hr’g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form I-589.) The political party fights for poor citizens that do not have a home or place to 8 = € Cay live. (d.) The MST Party locates land without an owner, and then attempts to secure the land for poor Brazilian citizens. (Id.) This is at odds with the Brazilian government, who obtains the land for wealthy Brazilian citizens, (Jd.) Respondent was a member of the MST Party for about four years, and as a member delivered pamphlets and documents with the Party’s message in various Brazilian towns. (/d.) Respondent also participated in a party committee during meetings. (Id.) Respondent credibly testified that he received three sets of threats. (Jd) Respondent stated that he received a threatening note at his home telling him to stop spreading the word of his party, or ‘he would lose his life, (/d.) Respondent next testified that he received a threatening phone call after moving to Vitoria. (Jd) The men on the phone stated that if he continued to participate in the MST Party, Respondent would lose his life. (/d.) Finally, the threats concluded in two men showing up to Respondent’s in-laws home in Iqaba, where they threatened both Respondent and his wife with a weapon. (/d.) The men told Respondent that he had a week to leave or he would die, because he still continued to support the MST Party. (/d.) In light of Respondent’s credible testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the harm he suffered in Brazil, the Court finds that Respondent has demonstrated that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground—namely his political opinion. See INA § 101(a)(42\\A); see, e.g., Kebede, 366 F.3d at 812; see, e.g., Duarte de Guinac, 179 F.3d at 1162, Consequently, the Court finds that the Respondent has established that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. See INA § {01(a)(42\\A); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1). iv, Whether the Government is Unable or Unwilling to Control the Prosecution A respondent must further establish that the persecution he suffered was either at the hands of the ‘government or by persons that the goverment is unable or unwilling to control. Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. at 222, In other words, the persecution must be inflicted under government sanction or by groups the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Baghdasaryan v. Holder, 592 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Rahimzadeh v. Holder, 613 F.3d 916, 923 (9th Cir. 2010) (cubstantial evidence supported the determination that Dutch authorities were willing and able to control extremists that attacked the alien); see also Desir v. lichert, 840 F.2d 723, 727-28 (9th Cir. 1988) (persecution by quasi-official Haitian security force). Furthermore, when the government is responsible for the persecution, there is no need to inquire whether a respondent sought help from the police. See Babaliah v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1067, 1078 (8th Cir, 2004); see also Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1082, 1088 (Sth Cir. 2005); see also Vitug v. Holder, 723 F.3d 1056, 1063~64 (9th Cit. 2013) (“While Vitug did not report these attacks, he credibly testified that it is well known in the Philippines that police harass gay men and turn a blind eye to hate crimes committed against gay men.”), In cases where the respondent failed to file a report, there is not a heightened burden of proof requirement. Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc). ‘The Court notes that Respondent has identified his persecutors in numerous ways, such os members of an opposition political party, people paid by members of an opposition political party, ‘government actors, and mercenaries paid by the opposition political party. (tir’g (May 3, 2019); Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) However, at the core of his asylum claim is that he was harmed by Brazilian government actors, or people closely associated with the Brazilian government, either hired as mercenaries or connected to high-level goverment officials. Given that the Court has found Respondent eredible, the Court finds through his cumulative experiences that Respondent has 9 o ‘ CO established that his fear of persecution is of Brazilian government actors, or of agents the Brazilian ‘government is unable or unwilling to control. Notably, when questioned Respondent recalled that the persecution he suffered was at the hands of members of the Brazilian government, such as mayors and council members. (Hir’g (May 3, 2019).) In his testimony, Respondent stated that if he returns to Brazil, he will either be tortured or killed by government actors. (/d.) This claim is supported by Respondent's credible testimony regarding the numerous threats against his life that were increasing in violence. (/d.) Respondent testified that he received three threats. (d.) In each of the three threats, Respondent was told he had to stop his participation in the MST Party, or he would be killed. (Id) Respondent submitted multiple news articles which highlight the violence MST Party members face in Brazil. (See Ex. 4, Resp't Docs. in Support of Hr’g.) According to a TeleSur English news article, the Brazilian President strongly opposes the MST. (Iwo Members of Brazil's MST Landless Movement Murdered, TELESUR ENGLISH, (Dec. 9, 2018).) The articles demonstrate that the MST Party is targeted by numerous Brazilian citizens, including supporters of the President. (See Ex. 4, Resp't Docs. in Support of Hr’g, at Reportagem 02.) For example, one of the leaders of the MST Party was attacked by supporters of the President. (id, at Reportages 03.) Respondent also submitted two news articles which reported the deaths of MST Party activists by armed men, (d,, Land rights activist shot dead in Brazilian Amazon hospital, THE GUARDIAN, Mar. 21, 2017; "
,"Two Members of Brazil's MST Landless Movement Murdered, TELeSUR ENGLISH, (Dec. 9, 2018),) Further, the articles state that “Brazil has become one of the world’s most dangerous countries for land rights activists,” which is a tenet of the MST Party. (Land rights activist shot dead in Brazilian Amazon hospital, THE GUARDIAN, Mar. 21,2017.) After the second telephonic threat, Respondent attempted to file a report with police in Vitoria, (Hs'g (May 3, 2019); see also Ex. 2, Form 1-589.) On this occasion, Respondent was told the police station system was not working. (Id) Instead, police officers took Respondent's information and telephone number; however, they never contacted Respondent again. (Jd) The police officers also did not allow Respondent to file any type of document at the station during this first visit. (Jd.) After the third incident, in which two men threatened Respondent and his wife at gunpoint, Respondent again reported the incident to the police. (/d) On this occasion, Respondent was able to file a police report. (Id; see also Ex. 4, Police Report.) The police officers took Respondent’s information, and told him they would research the incident, but Respondent never heard from the police again, In addition, Respondent also presented articles which discuss police corruption within Brazil. (Ex. 4, Resp't Docs. in Support of Hr’g,) Several articles submitted by Respondent suggest that police often accept bribes or other kinds of payment. (See id., at Reportages 06; Reportages 07.) This leads police to not fully investigate crimes, or to insert false data into police information systems. (id) Overall, the evidence of record demonstrates that the persecution Respondent suffered was either at the hands of the Brazilian government, or by agents the Brazilian government is unable ot ‘unwilling to control. Thus, Respondent has demonstrated past persecution on account of a Protected ground by the Brazilian government, or by persons the Brazilian government is unable or unwilling to control. See INA § 101(a)(42)(A); see also 8 CLF.R. § 1208.13(b\\1). 10 C cen B. Discretion Once a respondent has established that he is statutorily eligible for a grant of asylum, he must further show that he merits such relief as a matter of discretion. INA § 240(c)(4); 8 CER. § 1240.84); see also Kalubl v. Ashcroft, 364 F-3d 1134, 1137 (Sth Cir. 2004), Here, the Court finds that Respondent merits a favorable exercise of discretion. The Court believes that the Respondent sincerely fears for his life in Brazil, and finds that gencral humanitarian considerations militate in Respondent's favor. See id. Moreover, the Court believes that Respondent is capable of finding employment and becoming a contributing member of society in the United States. Finally, Respondent has not engaged in any activities indicating that he would not be a desirable member of society. In addition, both Respondent's wife and his newborn baby are present in the United States. (See Hr’g (May 3, 2019).) Consequently, the Court concludes that Respondent warrants a favorable exercise of discretion. See INA § 240(c)(4)(A). VI. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL UNDER INA § 241(b)(3) As the Court will grant Respondent’s application for asylum under INA § 208, the Court will not address Respondent's concurrent application for withholding of removal under INA § 241(b\\3) and will hold a decision on Respondent's application for such relief in abeyance. See Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. at 449; see also INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976). VH. PROTECTION UNDER THE CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. ‘As the Court will grant Respondent's application for asylum under INA § 208, the Court will not address Respondent’s concurrent application for protection under the Convention Against Torture CAT”), In light of the Courts decision to grant Respondent's application for asylum, the Court will hold a decision on Respondent’s application for protection under the CAT in abeyance. Vi. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Respondent is credible, that he has established his eligibility for asylum, and that he warrants relief as a matter of discretion. See INA §§ 208(a), 241(0)G). As the Court will grant Respondent's application for asylum, it will hold his concurrent application for withholding of removal and protection under CAT in abeyance.' See Mogharrabi, 19 IGN Dec. at 449; see also Bagamashad, 429 U.S. at 25 (“As a general rule courts and agencies ‘are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.”). In light of the above, the Court will enter the following orders: 2 The Court notes that Respondent's spouse is listed on his application, asa derivative applicant. As w result ofthis ‘Cour’s grant of Respondent's application, his spouse's application a a derivative asylee, would also be granted. u ORDERS: IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Respondent's application for Asylum under section 208 of the Act is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT Respondent’s application for Withholding of Removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act is HELD IN ABEYANCE. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT Respondent's application for protection under Article III of the Convention Against Torture is HELD IN ABEYANCE.

," that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group.” Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dee. at 335 (quoting Maiter of M-E-V-G-, 26 [&N Dec. at 239). This is true of Honduran females — itis clear who falls within the group and who does not. Honduran women are members of the group, while Honduran men and women of other nationalities are not. This particular record confirms that the concept of “Honduran females” as a whole is specifically defined as well, Exh. 3, Tab Mat I (noting that “gender-based violence is now the second highest cause of death for women of reproductive age in Honduras”); Exh. 4, Tab BB at 83 (“recognizing that “[mJale control over female bodies, and determination of female activities within the group are integral to gang culture”). Moreover, the group is not “defined by [its] vulnerability to private criminal activity,” rather, itis characterized by the shared experiences that are unique to women in Honduras, including job discrimination and the expectation that they be the primary caregivers in the home. Exh. 4, Tab AA at 50, 52; Cf Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 335. Therefore, the particular social group satisfies the particularity requirement. The particular social group comprised of “Honduran females” is cognizable because itis immutable, socially distinct, and defined with particularity, The Respondent has also established that she suffered harm because of her membership in this particular social group, At the young age of six, she was raped by two of her uncles and her cousin while she was visiting her mother. Exh, 4, Tab W at 2. When the Respondent reported this incestuous rape to her mother, her mother did not believe her and beat her instead of reporting the incident to the authorities. Jd. The Respondent was also the subject of a brutal gang rape by two men she met in Tegucigalpa when she was just ten years old. Jd. She immediately reported the incident to the authorities who declined to help her. Jd, She was raped daily and forced to act as a sex slave for the Mara 18 gang from the time she was ten years old 14 until her departure from Honduras when she was seventeen years old. /d. Prior to her entry in the ULS,, the Respondent suffered extreme violence at the hands of men who targeted her because of her status asa “Honduran female.” Country conditions evidence supports this finding as “[glirls are reportedly targeted from a young age by gangs with demands to become ‘wives’ or girlfriends of gang members.” Exh. 4, tab CC at 142-43. Additionally, itis evident that rape is, “a serious and pervasive societal problem” and that “violence against women is widespread and systematic” in Honduras. Exh. 4, Tab AA at 29; Exh. 3, Tab N at 45 (citation omitted), Specifically, gang members generally use rape as a weapon and a too! to control the masses. See ‘generally Exh. 3, Tab P; Exh, 4, Tab BB at 83 (noting that girls are often forced to engage in sexual relations with gang leaders). It is apparent that the Respondent's uncles, cousin, gang members, and other men in Honduras preyed on the Respondent's vulnerability as @ “Honduran female” to obtain sexual gratification and there is every indication that the Respondent would be susceptible to the same abuse if she went back to Honduras. These reports support the determination that the Respondent suffered harm because of her status as a “Honduran female” and that itis likely that she would face similar harm if she were to return to Honduras. The Respondent also hes provided sufficient evidence to establish that the government in Honduras is unwilling and unable to protect her from harm. The Respondent reported the incestuous rape that she suffered at the hands of her uncles and cousin to her mother, who proceeded to beat her instead of calling the authorities. Exh. 4, Tab W at 2. As the Respondent was only six years old at the time of the attack, itis natural that she would first go to her mother for help and would not be expected to file a police report of her own accord. Id. The Respondent also explained that she went to the police after she was gang raped in Tegucigalpa and they informed her that they could not do anything to help her. Jd. at 3. It is understandable that the Respondent would not seek the protection of the police again afier she was summarily dismissed when she attempted to report a rape. Additionally, the Honduran government does little to alleviate the sexual violence which takes place within its walls as “[vJiolence against ‘women and impunity for perpetrators continued to be a serious problem.” Exh. 4, Tab AA at 49. While the government seems to have enacted some laws to aid in the protection of females, these laws are rarely enforced and entirely ineffective, See Exh 4, Tab AA at 35, 49 (recognizing that the Honduran government has enacted laws criminalizing rape, but noting that “[c]orruption and impunity remained serious problems within the security forees.”). The Respondent's own 1s account, coupled with the country conditions evidence in the record, establish that the Honduran government is either unable or unwilling to protect the Respondent from the harm she fears. ‘The Respondent has demonstrated that she suffered past persecution on account of her membership in the particular social group comprised of “Honduran females.” The Respondent thus benefits from a presumption of well-founded fear of future persecution, and the Department has not rebutted that presumption. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208,16(b)(1)(j); see also Matter of A-T-, 25 1&N Dec. 4 (BIA 2009). 2, Serious Nonpolitical Crime Bar ‘The Department argues that the Respondent is subject to the serious nonpolitical crime bar because she participated in the torture of fellow and rival gang members under the direction of the Mara 18, The Respondent claims, in turn, that the acts she committed on the gang's behalf do not constitute serious nonpolitical crimes because she was forced to participate in this criminal activity and did not have the “wicked intent” required for the commission of a serious nonpolitical crime. She does not contend that her criminal behavior was nonpolitical in nature. ‘The Respondent's participation in the torture of other gang members would generally be considered a serious nonpolitical crime. In her asylum interview, the Respondent was forthright about her participation in this torture. See generally Exh. 6, She specifically noted that she was told to “make them suffer” if they did not tell the truth. Jd. According to the Respondent, this torture included “cutting them on some part of their body” and “electric shocks.” id. She also admit cd that she threatened their families with violence, if they refused to answer truthfully. Id. ‘The fact that the Respondent participated in the torture of other individuals is very concerning; however, the seriousness of the crime is mitigated by some outstanding factors. As noted by the asylum officer who reviewed the Respondent’s case at the USCIS, “in keeping with the language and structure of [] § 208(b)(2) [of the Act], additional factors” including “age, intent, knowledge and duress” should be “considered in determini 1g ifa crime is ‘serious.”* Exh, 6. In the case at hand, the Respondent was extremely young during the commission of the crime and was the subject of repeated sexual abuse at the hands of gang members. In her interview with the asylum office, she explained that she participated in the torture of other gang members to avoid violent rape and death. Jd. Additionally, she explained that she did not want to hurt other people, but that she felt that she “had to” in order to evade substantial harm of her ‘own. Jd. The Respondent also was suffering from severe mental health issues at the time of the 16 torture, including hallucinations, suicidal ideations, and psychosis. Exh. 3, Tab C at 7. The Respondent's young age, lack of intent, mental health issues and the fact that she was acting under penalty of rape and death are mitigating fuetors that lessen the “seriousness” of the erime at issue in this case. As such, the Respondent has not committed a serious nonpolitical crime. Even if the Respondent had committed a serious nonpolitical crime, she is eligible for a duress exception, There is no explicit duress exception for the serious nonpolitical crime bar, but duress is a common consideration when analyzing the consequences of criminal convictions. See US. v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 409 (1980) (noting that duress is an affirmative defense that “excuse{s] criminal conduct where the actor was under an unlawful threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury, which threat caused the actor to engage in conduct violating the literal terms of criminal law”). Indeed, the Board has considered coercion and duress in the context of serious nonpolitical crimes, In Matter of £-A-, the Board found that the respondent was subject to the serious nonpolitical crime bar because “generalized fear is not sufficient to show that he would have suffered any dire consequences, such as serious physical harm or economic persecution, if he had refused to participate in the group.” 26 I&N Dec. 1, 8 (BIA 2012). While the Board ultimately determined that the bar applied in Matter of E-A , it acknowledged that duress was a factor to be considered when applying the bar to the respondent's asylum application. id. Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Board’s finding that a Respondent was barred from relief for com Mejia v. Holder, $97 F. 34 360. 2369-370 (6\"" Cir. 2010), the possibility of a duress exception n of a serious nonpolitical crime in Urbina- was recognized. However, the Court upheld the finding that a fourteen-year-old young man had not been coerced into criminal acts as a gang member, based on the Judge’s finding that he had “possessed a fair amount of autonomy in that he shared in the proceeds of his crimes and carried a firearm.” This case at bar is easily distinguishable, since the Respondent was subject to the “slavery-like practices” that gangs inflict on young women (United Nations Humen Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, on her mission to El Salvador (Aug. 3, 2016) at 10) of sexual acts based on forced violence, and she did not have the level of autonomy described in Urbina-Mejia. In Matter of Negusie, the Board explicitly stated that a duress exception exists for the persecutor bar. 27 1&N Dec. 347 (BIA 2018). In doing so, the Board compared Section 203(e) 7 of the Refugee Act to Article 1F of the Exclusion Clauses “provided in the Convention.” /d. at 354-55, Section 203(e) of the Refugee Act enumerated the bars to relief, including the persecutor bar and the serious nonpolitical crime bar. Article IF of the Exclusion Clauses stated similar bars to protection under the Convention, When analyzing the two sections together, the Board noted that “the ‘serious nonpolitical crime’ provisions of sections 208(b)(2)(A)(iii) and 241(b\\3)(BY(ii) of the Act correspond to Article F1(b) of the Convention.” Jd. at 355 (citation omitted). The Board went on to find that there is a duress exception to the persecutor bar because “Congress intended that the persecutor bar be interpreted in a way that not only comports with [its] obligations under Article 1F(a) of the Convention but also reflects the international understanding of those obligations.” /d. at 356. ‘The Board believed that the Convention intended for the adjudicator to consider duress in determining whether to apply the persecutor bar to a respondent’s asylum application. /d. Based on the Board’s reasoning in Negusie and its willingness to consider duress with respect to the serious nonpolit ical crime bar in E-4-, it is appropriate to apply a duress exception in the case at hand, Given the similarities between the persecutor bar and the serious nonpotitical crime bar, the Court will apply the Negusie test to determine if the Respondent is eligible for a duress exception. Under this test, the Respondent must demonstrate that she “(1) acted under an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to {her]seif or others; (2) reasonably believed that the threatened harm would be carried out unless [s]he acted or refrained from acting; (3) had no reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise frustrate the threat; (4) did not place [her]self in a situation in which [s]he knew or reasonably should have known that [she would likely be forced to act or refrain from acting; and (5) knew or reasonably should have known that the harm [s]he inflicted was not greater than the threatened harm to fher]self or others.” Id. at 363. ‘The Respondent demonstrated that she “acted under imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” when she participated in the torture of fellow and rival gang members. Jd. The Respondent explained that she was subjected to brutal rape on a daily basis and was only able to get a reprieve from this sexual violence when she hurt other people on behalf of her abusers. Exh, 6. The Mara 18 gang members also threatened to torture if she did not comply with their orders. Exh. 4, Tab W at 3. The threatened harm was “imminent” as the gang members had already raped the Respondent and promised more sexual abuse if she refused to participate in the 18 torture. Exh. 4, Tab W at 3; Exh. 6. Accordingly, the Respondent “acted under imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” Matter of Negusie, 27 1&N Dee. at 363. ‘The Respondent also “reasonably believed that the threatened harm would be carried out” if she did not do as she was told. id. Again, the Respondent already was the subject of repeated abuse and knew that the gang members would follow through on their threats because they had done so in the past. Exh. 4, Tab W at 3; Exh. 6, Additionally, she saw the way that members of the Mara 18 treated people who did not comply with their demands. Exh. 6. Country conditions reports also support the Respondent’ contention that gang members follow through on their threats as they are known to use rape and violence as tools to control people. See generally Exh.3, Tab P. Based on her own experiences, as well as widely-known information about the actions of gang members in Honduras, the Respondent was reasonable in her belief that “the threatened harm would be carried out.” Matter of Negusie, 27 1&N Dec. at 363. ‘The Respondent did not have a “reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise frustrate the threat.” Jd. The Department claims that the Respondent was able to escape the gang once before when she was ten years old and went to Tegucigalpa to look for work. Exh. 4, Tab W at 2 ~3; Exh. 6, However, the Respondent was brutally gang raped by two men in Tegucigalpa and returned to her hometown to seeking protection after this traumatic event, Jd. Once she returned, she had no choice but to rejoin the gang, having been abandoned by her family, Exh. 4, Tab W at 2. This incident demonstrates that the Respondent tried and failed to get out from under the thumb of the Mara 18 gang, but was unable to strike out on her own without facing extreme sexual violence. /d. at 2—3. After returning to her hometown, she was again forcefully rectuited by the Mara 18 gang and acquiesced to their demands under threat of death. Id. at 3. When she was actually able to escape again, she fled to the United States with her sister and sought asylum. Jd. The Respondent took the first “reasonable opportunity” she had to leave the Mara 18 and escaped to the United States. Matter of Negusie, 27 I&N Dee. at 363 ‘The Respondent did not “place (herself] in a situation in which [sJhe knew or reasonably should have known that [sJhe would likely be forced to act.” Id. The Respondent was recruited into the Mara 18 gang at an extremely young age under threat of force. Exh. 4, Tab W at 2-3. At the time of the forceful recruitment, the Respondent had been abandoned by her family and suffered significant physical and sexual abuse. /d. She had nowhere else to tur and feared harm to herself and members of her family if she refused. /d, at 3. Her gang membership and 19 participation in torture was entirely involuntary and she did not willingly put herself into a situation that would require her to harm other people. lly, the Respondent also “knew... that the harm [s]he inflicted was not greater than the threatened harm” to herself. Matter of Negusie, 27 1&N Dec. at 363. Gang members threatened the Respondent with repeated rape and death if she did not follow their orders. Exh. 4, Tab W at 3; Exh. 6. In her asylum interview, she stated that gang members “would have done the same to her” if she refused to hurt people on their behalf. Exh. 6. She did suffer worse harm as she was raped daily and was sometimes forced to have sex with two to three gang members at the same time. Exh. 6. They also tortured her when “she did not comply with their orders.” Exh.4, Tab W at 3. The fact that the Respondent hurt other gang members to escape even a bit of this daily abuse and potential death demonstrates that she knew that the harm to herself was the same as, if not greater than, the atrocities that the Mara 18 gang members committed and threatened to commit against her person. “The Respondent satisfied the five-factor Negusie test. Accordingly, she is eligible for a duress exception to the serious nonpolitical crime bar. As such, the Respondent’s application for asylum will be granted. C, Withholding of Removal under § 241(b)(3) of the Act and Relief under the Convention Against Torture ‘Since the Respondent has established eligibility for asylum under Section 208 of the Act, it is not necessary to reach the merits of her claim for withholding under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or for relief pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, as asylum is a greater benefit which obviates the necessity of withholding of removal. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (noting that “courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”). VII. Conclusion ‘The Respondent has also demonstrated that there is a reasonable possibility that she will face future persecution on account of her membership in ¢ particular social group defined as “Honduran females.” She also has established that she is not subject to the serious nonpolitical crime bar, Therefore, the Respondents applicotion for asylum is granted. As a grant of asylum confers a greater benefit upon the Respondent, the Court will not reach the merits of her applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. 20 In light of the foregoing, the following order is entered: ORDER It is hereby ordered that: Respondent's application for asylum pursuant to § 208 of the Act is GRANTED."

She entered the United States at or near Eagle Pass, Texas on January 22, 2014, without being admitted or paroled, Exh, 1, On March 3, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) commenced removal proceedings against the Respondent by-filing a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) with the Immigration Court. Exh. 1, On December 10, 2014, venue was changed to the Newark Immigration Court. At the initial master calendar hearing in Newark on May 31, 2016, DHS withdrew number four of the factual allegations contained in the NTA and amended the charges of inadmissibility from section 212(a\\(7)(A)(i)(1) to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i). The Respondent, through counsel, admitted the four remaining factual allegations in the NTA and conceded the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Accordingly, the Court sustained the charge, At the same master hearing, the Respondent filed an I-589 Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal with a detailed statement, Exh. 2, On February 13, 2019, she filed an updated 1-589 application. Exh, 2U On March 6, 2019, the Respondent appeared at her merits hearing and testified under oath at both hearings with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter. Il. Summary of the Evidence A. Documentary Evidence The evidentiary record of this proceeding consists of documentary Exhibits 1 through 7, All admitted evidence has been considered regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision, Exhibit 1: Notice to Appear, filed March 3, 2014 Exhibit 2: 1-589 Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal and detailed statement, filed May 31, 2016 Exhibit 2U: Updated 1-589 Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal, filed February 13, 2019 Exhibit 3: Supplemental Evidence in Support of -589 Application (Tabs B, D~H), filed May 31, 2016 Exhibit 4: Supplemental Evidence in Support of 1-589 Application (Tabs A - C), filed September 20, 2016 Exhibit 5: Supplemental Evidence in Support of I-589 Application (Tab A), filed August 9, 2017 Exhibit 6: Psychological Evaluation by Jenny Lozano-Rivera, MSW, LCSW, filed February 13, 2019 Exhibit 7: Motion to Amend Respondent's Statement and Supplemental Evidence in Support of 1-589 Application (Tabs A, B, F), filed February 13, 2019 B, Testimonial Evidence ‘The Respondent was born on March 18, 1987 in Managua, Nicaragua. Exh. 2U. On June 8, 2005, she met her common law husband, i). [1 August 2005, the Respondent and IM began to cohabitate together ail s mother’s home. At the beginning, the Respondent was happy in the relationship andiMMBLdid not mistreat her. However, on August 20, 2006, the relationship started to deteriorate. It began with small, occasional fights, which grew in intensity and frequency. NMMbegan coming home late at night. When the Respondent Page 2 of 11 inquired into his whereabouts, he would become angry, which would lead to a fight. Eventually, she became too afraid to speak tClJlIbecause of his angry outbursts On October 13, 2006, which wasfijqumms birthday, the Respondent left their home because of the verbal abuse and went to stay with her parents. She spoke with her sister INN who frequently traveled to Honduras and El Salvador for work, and decided to go with her. On October 2006, the Respondent traveled to Honduras withilNllillwhere she remained for approximately one month, When she returned INNMvas infuriated that she had left without his permission, He called her a “bitch” and told her that she had gone to Honduras to work as a prostitute and to sleep with her various lovers. AlthoughMllgidid not hit her, he told the Respondent that she was his property and that if she did not belong to him, she would not belong to anyone else. He also threatened to kill her by telling her not to report him because if she did he would be let out of jail, but she would never leave the cemetery On February 10, 2008, the Respondent decided to end her relationship with She went to live with her parents twenty minutes away. Then, on February 15, 2008, she left for Honduras with her sistelNNI For the following two-and-a-half months, the Respondent worked with her sister selling clothes and divided her time between Honduras and Nicaragua. During this time frequently went to the Respondent’s parents’ home looking for her. He also tried to convince her mother that he had changed. On May 15, 2008, the Respondent reconciled witHMllland resumed living with him at his mother’s home. In August 2008, she became pregnant NEEMbecame infuriated that she was pregnant and claimed that the child was not his, but from one of her lovers. Their so?7, i EEE wa born on April 3, 2009, via a caesarean section. The week after the Respondent gave birth and was recovering from her caesarean section, MEE came infuriated when the baby would not stop crying early in the morning. He reiterated that the baby was not his and that it was the child of one of her lovers. The Respondent told him that they could have a DNA test to prove paternity. MIIthen slapped her twice in the face and grabbed her by the hair and pulled her so he was twisting her neck, The Respondent’s mother-in- law heard her screaming and came to he!pgmmipunched his mother in the face, leaving her with a swollen eye. Neither the Respondent nor her mother-in-law filed a police report or sought medical treatment for fear of MINNIS reaction. Following this incident ANNMNNINs behavior continued to become more violent, He began raping the Respondent regularly. He called her names like “son of a bitch” and told her she was “worthless,” “disgusting,” and “fat.” He told her she belonged to him and threatened to kill her and her family if she tried to leave or report him In July 2009, the Respondent tried to leavdMlagain by escaping to Honduras with her sister INNNNMFor a third time. At the time of her departure from Nicaragua, she did not intend to return home because of her fear off. She stayed in Honduras for approximately 20 days, but then left for El Salvador when she heard thdMMMMhad travelled to Honduras looking for her. She stayed in El Salvador for approximately 15 days before he found her there. ‘The Respondent was selling clothes in a park near where she was staying When [Ill showed up. He called her a “fucking slut” and forced her to return to Nicaragua with him. During the bus ride back to Page 3 of 11 ‘Nicaragua, he mistreated her. Once they arrived back at his mother's house IJINNMleat her and repeatedly raped her. The Respondent remained in Nicaragua in a forced relationship with for the next four-and-a-half years. During this time INJIlllrepeatedly beat her and their son. He frequently swore at her, stole from her, and demanded that she work and provide for him. IM also continued to rape her regularly On January 7, 2014, the Respondent lef NNNNMIfor the last time and fled Nicaragua for the United States. She left her son with her parents in Nicaragua because she could not afford to bring, him. Since she left, her mother has been told that INlvants to take the child. IMhas gone to the Respondent's parents’ home searching for the child. The Respondent fears returning to her country of origin because she fears JEN will Kill her. For many years she was too scared to leavelIINbecause he threatened to kill her and her family if she left him. She was also too scared to report the abuse to the police because she had seen on the news that women who reported spouses for domestic violence were not protected and the husbands were not punished. Often these women ended up murdered by their abusive partners. Now that she has left her partner, the Respondent fears that he will kill her if she returns and that the police will do nothing to protect her. Additionally, the Respondent does not believe she will be safe anywhere in Nicaragua since she has gone so far as to move to Honduras and El Salvador tono avail beceuselINNNEMvas able to find her. IM. Relief from Removal—Law and Analysis A. Timeliness An applicant for asylum must prove by clear and convincing evidence that her asylum application was timely filed within one year of the date of her last arrival into the United States. INA § 208(a)(2)(B); 8 CFR. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii). Here, the parties do not dispute the timeliness of the Respondent's application for relief, B. Application of The REAL ID Act of 2005 All applications for relief filed after May 11, 2005 are subject to the REAL ID Act of 2005. The REAL ID Act amended INA § 208 and places all burdens of proof on the applicant. INA § 240(c)(4). ‘The applicant must establish that she satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements and that she merits a favorable exercise of discretion for relief. In this case, the REAL ID Act governs the Respondent's application. 1. Credibility As a threshold matter, the Court must make a determination of the Respondent’ credibility. A credibility finding is independent of an analysis of the sufficiency of an applicant's evidence. Chen v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir. 2005). Pursuant to the REAL ID Act, credibility determinations will be made “considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors.” INA § 240(c)(4)(C). A trier of fact may base a credibility determination on Page 4 of 11 ee a demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant’s or witness's written and oral statements, the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record, and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility; however, if'no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) (emphasis added); see generally, Lin v. Att'y Gen,, 543 F.3d 114 Gd Cir. 2008) (affirming the 1’s adverse credibility determination based on discrepancies between his testimony and affidavit). The statutory language suggests that all relevant factors in the record be considered when determining credibility and that all the circumstances be considered when weighing any one factor, After a careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Court finds the Respondent credible. Her testimony was generally consistent with her detailed declaration and generally consistent with the evidence in the record. The Respondent was forthcoming and candid with information that was asked of her. The Court notes that there were some discrepancies between the Respondent’s testimony at the first individual hearing on August, 16, 2017 and the evidence presented with regard to the Respondent's trips to Honduras and El Salvador. However, afier taking these discrepancies into consideration, the Court finds that they do not detract from the Respondent's overall credibility 2. Corroboration An applicant bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion in connection with any application under INA § 208. INA § 208(b(1)(B); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a); Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 215 (BIA 1985), modified on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439, 446 (BIA 1987). An applicant’s own testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum without corroboration if the testimony is credible, persuasive, and “refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.” INA § 208(b)(1)(BYii); 8 CER. § 1208.13(a); Sandie v, Au'y Gen., 362 F.3d 246, 252 n.2 (3d Cir. 2009); Matter of J-Y-C- +24 1&N Dec. 260, 263 (BIA 2007). The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has recognized the difficulties an asylum applicant may face obtaining documentary or other corroborative evidence to support his claim of persecution. Matter of Dass, 20 1&N Dec. 124 (BIA 1989). As such, “[uJnreasonable demands are not placed on an asylum applicant to present evidence to corroborate particular experiences (e.g., corroboration from the persecutor).” Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 725 (BIA 1997). However, the weaker an applicant’s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence. Matter of Y-B-, 21 I&N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998) (citing Matter of E-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 860 (BIA 1997)) (determining that a finding of credible testimony by an asylum applicant is not dispositive as to whether asylum should be granted; rather, the specific content of the testimony and any other relevant evidence should be considered). ‘The ithholding of removal provision in INA § 241 refers to the corroboration provision contained in Page $ of 11 Cz INA § 208, indicating thet withholding applicants must also comply with the corroboration requirement of asylum applicants. In the event that the Court expects corroborating evidence, the Court must give the applicant notice of what corroborating evidence will be expected and the opportunity to provide such evidence or provide an explanation if the applicant cannot produce such corroboration. Saravia v, Att'y Gen., 905 F.34. 729, 737 (3d Cir. 2018) (finding that it was not fair to require the petitioner to provide further corroboration without telling him so and giving him the opportunity either to supply that evidence or to explain why it was not available). ‘The Court finds that the Respondent has corroborated her claim through, inter alia, country condition reports on Nicaragua (Exh. 3, 4, 7), a letter from the Jersey City Battered Women’s Services (Exh. 5), a psychological evaluation (Exh. 6), an affidavit from her sis‘ —_i OE, ond an affidavit from her fathc i The Respondent provided the affidavits of her sister and father after the Court gave her the opportunity to submit corroborating documents under Saravia, These corroborating documents, coupled with the Respondent's testimony, are sufficient to meet the standard for corroboration. C. Asylum under Section 208 of the Act Analien bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion regarding eligibility for relief from removal. Section 240(c) of the Act. To be eligible for asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act, the Respondent must establish that she was persecuted in the past or that she has a well- founded fear of persecution in the future on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. See section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act; INS v, Elias- Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992); 8 C.F-R. § 1208.13(a). A claim of persecution must have a nexus to one of the five statutorily protected grounds. In cases where the REAL ID Act applies, such as, this case, the applicant must demonstrate that the protected ground would be “at least one central reason” for the persecution. Section 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. The protected ground does not need to be “the only central reason for the persecution ... [further,] an applicant need not prove that a protected ground was the most important reason why the persecution occurred.” Ndayshimiye v. Att'y Gen., 557 F.3d 124, 130 (3d Cir. 2009). If the Respondent establishes past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, it “shall be presumed that [her] life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.” 8 CF.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). The persecution must be or have been committed by the government or by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Gao v. Asherofi, 299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir. 2002); Kibinda v. Att'y Gen. 477 F.3d 113, 119 (Bd Cir. 2007) (quoting Fiadjoe v. Att'y Gen., 411 F.3d 135, 160 (3d Cir. 2005). 1. Past Persecution There is no universally accepted definition of “persecution.” See Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 51 (Geneva, January 1992), While “persecution” has generally been interpreted to include threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom, courts have also recognized that “the concept of persecution Page 6 of 11 i _ is broad enough to include governmental measures that compel an individual to engage in conduct that is not physically painful or harmful but is abhorrent to that individual's deepest beliefs.” Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1242 (3d Cir. 1993). Evidence that an asylum applicant was physically harmed by her persecutors and that the harm was severe and required medical attention, along with other harassment, may rise to the level of persecution. See Voci v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 607, 615 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding past persecution where the petitioner was found to have been beaten by police numerous times, which on one occasion, necessitated the petitioner’s extended hospitalization for a broken knee), Persecution does not, however, require that the applicant sustain permanent or serious injuries. Matter of O-Z- & I-Z-, 22 1&N Dec. 23, 25-26 (BIA 1998) (holding that persecution “encompasses a variety of forms of adverse treatment, including non-life threatening violence and physical abuse or non- physical forms of harm.\""); Gomez-Zuluaga v. Att'y Gen,, 527 F.3d 330, 341-45 (3d Cir. 2008). Furthermore, the severity of each incident should not be addressed in isolation without considering the cumulative effect of events. Fei Mei Cheng v, Ait'y Gen., 623 F.3d 175, 190-98 (3d Cir. 2010). Unfulfilled threats are not substantial enough to be characterized as past persecution. See Li v, Atl'y Gen., 400 F.3d 157 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding that unfulfilled threats must be highly imminent and menacing in nature to constitute persecution). Only where threats are “so menacing as 10 cause significant actual suffering or harm” may they constitute persecution, Chavarria v: Gonzalez, 446 F.3d 508, 518 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Liv. Att'y Gen. 400 F.3d 157 (3d Cir. 2005). The Court finds that the Respondent suffered harm that rises to the level of past persecution, She was in a nine-year-long relationship withINJINNthat was characterized by constant verbal, physical, and sexual abuse as well as emotional manipulation. Between 2005 and 2008, emotionally and verbally abused the Respondent, He controlled her by threatening to kill her and her family if she tried to leave him, Although he did not follow through on these threats, they were accompanied by physical and sexual violence, which makes them highly imminent and menacing. He was also verbally abusive and called her names like “son of a bitch,” “worthless,” “disgusting,” and “fat.” Immediately following the birth of the Respondent's son,IININNEEs abuse escalated to constant verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Iliibeat her countless times, including in front of her son, and, over a period of four-and-a-half years, he frequently raped her. The level of control and abuse in the relationship is further evidenced by the fact that INJNNNM followed the Respondent to Honduras and El Salvador and forced her to return through threats and intimidation. The lasting effect of the severity of the Respondent's harm is also highlighted by the fact that she takes part in a domestic violence support group at Jersey Battered Women’s Service; Exh. 5; and her psychological evaluation indicates a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Exh. 6. 2. Nexus to a Protected Ground ~ Particular Social Group ‘The Third Circuit has adopted the BIA’s definition of a particular social group as a group of individuals who share a “common, immutable characteristic” that cannot be changed or they should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences. See Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233 (3d Cir. 1993) (adopting the standard set forth in Matter of Acosta, 19 [&N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985)). The particular social group identified must be: Page 7 of 11 geananeinnasn a ene ate ane eel a (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic; (2) defined with particularity; and (3) socially distinct within the society in question. SERL. v. Att'y Gen, 894 F.3d 535, 535 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that Matter of M-E-V-G- is entitled to Chevron deference); see also Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014). To show persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, the respondent must establish a cognizable particular social group, that she is a member of that group, and that the persecution was based on that membership. See Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d at 1239-40. In order for a particular social group to be cognizable, it must “exist independently” of the harm asserted. Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 334 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Matter of M-E- 26 I&N Dec. 227, 236 n.11, 243 (BIA 2014)). A particular social group “cannot be defined exclusively by the fact that its members have been subjected to harm.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 242 (BIA 2014) (internal quotations omitted). “{T]he individuals in the group must share a narrowing characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted.” Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 335 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Rreshpja v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir. 2005)), At the merits hearing on March 6, 2019, the Respondent claimed that she suffered past persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group, namely, 1) Nicaraguan ‘women who are viewed as property; 2) Nicaraguan women who are unable to leave their relationship; and 3) Nicaraguan women who resist their partners but are unable to leave their relationship. The second and third social groups the Respondent articulated are not cognizable under Matter of A-B-. See Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 334 (A.G. 2018). Thus, the Court finds these groups are not cognizable. Additionally, the evidence of record and the Respondent’s testimony lead this Court to conclude that the final social group, “Nicaraguan women who are viewed as property,” is not applicable in this matter and thet the more applicable particular social group is “Nicaraguan women.” Thus, the Court will proceed to analyze whether this group is cognizable under the standards set forth in Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014) and Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018). @ Nicaraguan women First, the proposed social group of “Nicaraguan women’ is immutable because gender and nationality are immutable characteristics that members of the group cannot or should not have to change. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 233 (holding that the enumerated grounds in the Act, including nationality, describe “an immutable characteristic: a characteristic that either is beyond the power of an individual to change or is so fundamental to individual identity or conscience that it ought not be required to be changed” and that in the context of particular social groups “[t]he shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex ...”). Second, the Court finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that the group is sufficiently particular. A particular social group must be defined by characteristics that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 239 (citing Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, 24 I&N Dee. 69, 76 (BIA 2007)). The terms used to describe the group must have commonly accepted definitions in the society of which the group is a part. Id. The group must be discrete and have definable boundaries—it must not be amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective. 1d. Here, it is clear who falls within the social group “Nicaraguan women” and who does not because nationality and gender have commonly understood definitions that limit and define the Page 8 of 11 Ss a membership of the group. The group also is not defined by the harm and clearly exists independently of the underlying harm. See Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. at 317. Finally, “Nicaraguan women” is a socially distinct group in Nicaragua. “Social distinction” means social recognition, or “whether the people of a given society would perceive a proposed group as sufficiently separate or distinct [.]” M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee, at 241. Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that Nicaraguan society perceives the Respondent's particular social group as distinct. The law shows that members of the Respondent’s social group are treated differently and seen as a distinct group under Nicaraguan law. Specifically, although gender equality is protected under the law, “women often experience ] discrimination in employment, credit, and pay equity for similar work, as well as in owning and managing businesses.” 207 U.S. Depariment of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, p. 22. Additionally, “NGOs complain{ } of delayed justice caused by judicial inaction and widespread impunity, especially regarding family and domestic violence and sexual abuse,” which are issues that disproportionately impact ‘women. Jd. at 8. Women’s organizations also reported that there were “unofficial orders” in the judiciary to decline ordering jail time or pretrial detention in domestic violence cases. Id. at 9 Furthermore, issues that primarily impact women, such as rape, domestic violence, and sexval harassment, are also outlawed. Jd. at 21. However, a recent change in the law has put in place a ‘mediation process specific to domestic violence complaints. Id. The presence of such extensive legal protections for women, and the different treatment women and issues that impact them receive, indicate that Nicaraguan society recognizes women as a distinct group in society. Finally, ‘women are not as influential in Nicaraguan society; for example, “most women in elected positions at the municipal or national level hfold] limited power or influence within their respective bodies.” Id, at 18. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has demonstrated that “Nicaraguan women” is a cognizable particular social group. Furthermore, the Respondent has shown that at least one of the central reasons targeted her was on account of her membership in the particular social group “Nicaraguan women,” Byron felt entitled to abuse her because she is a woman and domestic violence is committed with impunity in Nicaragua. 2017 U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, pp. 8-9, 21. He told her that she belonged to him, indicating a feeling of ownership over her because of her inferior status as a woman. He also refused to accept that she no longer wished to be in a relationship with him, and even went so far as to follow her to Honduras and then E] Salvador. He told her that if she reported him, he would be let free and she would end up in the cemetery, demonstrating that he felt at liberty to target the Respondent because women are not protected or seen as equals. Thus Sargeted the Respondent because she is a Nicaraguan ‘woman Therefore, the Court finds that the Respondent has established that her past persecution was on account of her membership in the particular social group “Nicaraguan women.” 3. Persecution the Government is Unable or Unwilling to Control Page 9 of 11 | zz An applicant for asylum must demonstrate that the persecution was committed by the government or by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. Kibinda v. Att'y Gen., 477 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir. 2007). The Respondent testified that women in relationships are not afforded protection by the Nicaraguan government and men are able to abuse their partners with impunity. Police do not protect women from abusive partners and do not punish perpetrators of domestic violence. The Respondent's testimony is corroborated by country conditions in the evidence of record, Cases involving domestic violence and sexual abuse are characterized by “judicial inaction and widespread impunity.” 2017 U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, p. 8 Domestic violence cases continue to be subject to the unofficial order to refrain from ordering jail time or pretrial detention, Jd. at 9. Although rape and domestic violence are criminalized, “the government failfs] to enforce the law effectively, leading to widespread impunity and reports of increased violence from released offenders emboldened by their release.” Jd. Furthermore, “violence against women over the past eight years [has increased in severity} and th{e] police generally understated the level of violence against women.” Jd, at 21 Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Respondent has shown that the Nicaraguan government is unable or unwilling to protect her. 4, Rebuttable Presumption of Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Since the Respondent has established past persecution in Nicaragua on account of a protected ground, she is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution if she must return to Nicaragua. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). The DHS bears the burden to rebut the Respondent's presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. Specifically, the DHS must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent's fear is no longer well-founded due to a fundamental change in circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). The presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution may also be overcome if the DHS demonstrates that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that it would be reasonable to do so. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). DHS must show that there is a specific area of the country where the risk of persecution to the applicant falls below the well-founded fear level. Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 28, 33 (BIA 2012). In this case, the DHS failed to rebut the"
,"presumption that the Respondent has a well- founded fear of future persecution by either showing that intemal relocation is possible and reasonable or a fundamental change in circumstances. Accordingly, the Respondent has met all the requirements for asylum and the Court will grant the application as a matter of discretion. D. Withholding of Removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act and Withholding of Removal under the Convention Against Torture Because the Court grants the Respondent’s application for asylum, it need not reach the merits of her applications for withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. See Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. at 449; see also INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S, 24 (1976) (government agencies are not required to make findings on issues which are unnecessary to the result), Page 10 of 11 fe —_—— In light of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent's application for asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act is GRANTED: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent's application for withholding of removal to Nicaragua pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act is NOT REACHED; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent's application for withholding or deferral of removal to Nicaragua pursuant to the Convention Against Torture is NOT REACHED. pas 1Z/~ Cee Hon, Shifta Rubin Immigration Judge Page 11 of 11"

,"establish a cognizable PSG. See C-A:, 23 I&N Dec. at 957. Indeed, the Board has found several diverse groups to be defined with particularity. The Court reiterates that in Toboso-Alfonso, the Board held that a group comprised of homosexuals in Cube constitutes a particular social group. 20 1&N Dec. at 822-23. No group will have more diversity among its members than a group defined by sexual orientation, as the group will have members of varying ages, social classes, economic statuses, and places of residence. In spite of the wide diversity of the other characteristics of membership, however, the fact remains that homosexuals have a characteristic that makes them part of a particular social group: their sexual orientation, Similarly, in Matter of V-T-S-. the Board found “Filipinos of Chinese Ancestry” constituted a particular social group. 21 I&N Dec. 792, 798 (BIA 1997). This group is also not limited by age, sex, economic status, or any particular belief. ‘The only unifying characteristic of that group is their Chinese ancestry. Like in Toboso-Alfonso and V-T-S-, Respondent's group here, “Guatemalan women” include a diverse range of members, but the group contains characteristics that make it sufficiently particular, namely, their sex and nationality. ‘The Court also finds that that Respondent's proposed group exists independent of the harm its members suffer. See A-B-, 316 at 334 (“To be cognizable, a particular social group must ‘exist independently’ of the harm asserted in an application for asylum or statutory withholding of removal.”) (emphasis in the original) (citing M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 236 n.11, 243). The harm the members suffer does not create any of the characteristics they share; rather, very clearly, as discussed infra, the characteristics of the members give rise to the harm. See Exh, 2, Tab G; Exh. 3, TabK, Apart from any abuse wortien suffer, Guatemalan society treats them separately from the rest of society because of their gender. See Exh. 2, Tab G; Exh. 3, Tab K. Third, Respondent's proposed social group is socially distinct, In M-E-V-G-, the Board explained that “{a] viable particular social group should be perceived within the given society as a sufficiently distinct group,” and that “[tJhe members of a particular social group will generally understand their own affiliation with the grouping, as will other people in the particular society.” 26 I&N Dec. 227, 238; see also W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 217 (stating that “social distinction exists where the relevant society perceives, considers, or recognizes the group as a distinct social group”). Respondent provided several country condition reports and articles establishing that Guatemalan society perceives women as sufficiently distinct from society generally. In Guatemala violence against women, including rape and domestic violence, is a serious problem. Exh. 3, Tab K at 199-200, 281-285, 351, 379, 389. Indeed, Guatemala has the one of the highest rates of femicide, defined as the “murder of women because of their gender,” in the world. Id. at 379. The violence perpetrated against women in Guatemala is due to discrimination against women, u including a culture of deep rooted gender bias and machismo. Id. at 196, 200, 281, 283, 348; Exh, 2, Tab G at 165. The machismo culture is premised on the notation that men have the power and authority to control women and renders all women as subservient to men. 1d, at 269; Exh. 2, Tab Gat 165,“Women are commonly viewed as the “daughters” of their husbands, and as such, women must obey their partners.” Exh, 2, Tab-G at-165. As-such-it is widely-accepted that men have the right to abuse women. Id,; Exh. 3, Tab K at 380. Those women who do not conform to their expected role or place as women in society are penalized for being “bad” and deserving of any mistreatment they face from men. See Exh. 2, Tab G at 165. Due to the pervasive violence and discrimination against women, the Guatemalan government has recognized the need to protect women and has enacted several laws to combat violence and discrimination against women. See Exh. 3, Tab K at 199-200. Yet despite laws enacted to foster gender equality and criminalize discrimination, women continue to face discrimination and are less likely to hold management positions. Id, at 200, Likewise, violence against women remains a serious problem in Guatemala, Id, at 199-200. Indeed, more than two ‘women are killed each day because of their gender. See id, at 379. This attributed to the ingrained machismo culture and the government’s failure to effectively enforce the laws passed to protect women. Id. at 199-200, 242, 256-57. Notably, there are several reported incidents of discrimination against women by the police and the “police had minimal training or capacity to investigate sexual crimes or assist survivors of such crimes, and the government did not enforce the law effectively.” Id, at 199-200, Police also often failed to respond to requests for assistance to domestic violence. Id. at 200. The situation is particularity worse for indigenous women. Id. at 302, 351-52. They are described as the most marginalized, powerless, and vulnerable members of Guatemalan society due to their race and gender. 14, at 348, They usually have limited access to Justice for abuse because police stations are not located in their remote villages. Id, at 302. They also often times face difficulties in communicating with the police because the police do not speak their native language. Id. Accordingly, the Court finds that taken as a whole, Respondent has shown that Guatemalan women are “set apart, or distinct, from other persons within [Guatemala] in s —significant way: ME 5 26 TSN Dec, at 238. AS discussed, society treats women as inferior to men, permits violence against women who fail to comply with their societal role, and the government has recognized the need to protect this vulnerable group. See Exh. 2, Tab G; Exh. 3, Tab K. Therefore, Respondent's articulated social group meets the requirements for social distinction and is cognizable under the Act. The Court further finds that Respondent is a member of this group, as she is a Guatemalan female. 2. Nexus Between Harm and Guatemalan Women PSG In addition to establishing membership in a particular social group, an applicant must show that a “nexus” exists between the persecution alleged and the protected ground, W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 223; J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 212-14; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(6)(1). The protected ground cannot play a minor role in the mistreatment and cannot be incidental, tangential, or superficial to another reason for the harm. Ndayshimiye v. U.S, Att'y Gen., 557 F.3d 124, 130 3d Cir, 2009); J-B-N- & S-M, 24 T&N Dec. at 214; Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486, 490 (BIA. 1996). As long as the applicant shows that one central reason for the persecution faced was on 2 account of the protected ground, the applicant may establish eligibility for relief. See J-B-N- & S- Me, 24 I&N Dec. at 212. The Third Circuit has stressed that the proper standard is “one central reason” and not “the central reason.” See Ndayshimive, 557 F.3d at 129-31 (finding that the BIA’s decision in S-Mc is not entitled to- Chevron deference to the extent that it requires that an applicant prove that their-asserted protected-ground-was not subordinate-to-another reason for — harm); Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec, 526, 529 (BIA 2011). In making this determination, the Court can consider both direct and circumstantial evidence of a persecutor’s motive and may make reasonable inferences based on the evidence in the record, N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 529; Matter of DER-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 453 (BIA 2011). Here, in drawing all reasonable inferences based on the evidence in the record, the Court finds that Respondent's status as a Guatemalan woman was “one central reason” for her persecution, Respondent was physically abused by her husband, Maweajwesiiqg for the majority of their twenty-two year marriage. During the several incidents of abuse she suffered at the hands of Gemma, he routinely demeaned Respondent's gender, calling her a “worthless woman” and attempted to dominate their relationship. See supra § ILB. Indeed, Respondent described balay ewe has a “machista” or male chauvinist who appeared to have specific views of the role of ‘women, See supra § II-B; see also Exh. 2, Tab C at 18 (Respondent's affidavit discussing her fear of retuming to face Mr, Ajxollip), Pointedly, Respondent recalled that he would not only physically abuse her, but would also routinely follow her whenever she left the home because he demanded to know her every whereabouts; thereby demonstrating his need to control or dominate their relationship, See supra § ULB; see also Exh, 2, Tab C at 18 (Respondent's affidavit). He further criticized his ex-wife as being lazy simply because she did not prepare his food on a timely basis further illustrating his machismo beliefs that women should be subservient to men. See supra § ILB. Respondent’s experience of abuse at the hands of Namdimmiigp fits neatly into the pattem of threats and violence inflicted on Guatemalan females on account of their gender. See Exh. 2, Tab G at 162~65; Exh. 3, Tab K at 269, 277-85, 380. The record shows that gender is a primary cause for domestic violence and abuse of women, particularly in Guatemala. See Exh. 2, Tab G at 16265; Exh: 3; Tab Kat 269, 277-85, 380, Indeed, women in Guatemala are subjected to high levels of violence because they live in a “machista culture that treats women as inferior fand] has normalized the violence and murder of women,” Exh. 3, Tab K at 380; see Exh, 2, Tab G at 165. ‘With respect to motives of batterers of women, like Maqmssjmetiie, it is reported that: {tJhe male batterer is motivated by a firm belief in male privilege, which expresses itself in an expectation that men and women conform to traditional and rigid gender roles. The batterer treats his wife or partner like a servant rather than as an equal partner, acts like the “master of the castle,” and assumes authority to define men’s and women’s gender roles and make final decisions regarding what his wife or partner will or will not do. His partner’s failure to fulfil his traditional and rigid expectations for how a woman ought to behave may trigger an episode of abuse or violence. . . Exh. 3, Tab K at 366. 3 Accordingly, the Court finds that the totality of the record demonstrates that #5 abused Respondent because of her status as a Guatemala woman. As discussed, dalammiamiig routinely mentioned her gender when he abused her and holds “machista” views of women, which ‘as corroborated by the country conditions evidence is the catalyst behind the shocking levels of violence against women-in Guatemala, See Exh. 2,-TabG at 162-65; Exh-3, Tab K at 269, 277= 85, 380, Therefore, the Court finds that Respondent has met her burden in demonstrating a nexus between her fear of persecution and her membership in a particular social group consisting of Guatemalan women. ¢. Unwilling or Unable to Control Respondent also must demonstrate that the Guatemalan government was unable or unwilling to protect her from aFRIMB. See Gao, 299 F.3d at 272, An applicant secking to establish persecution based on conduct of a private actor must show that “the goverment condoned the private actions ‘or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victim.”” A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 337. While not binding on this Court, the Court finds the First Circuit Court of Appeals’ (“First Circuit”) analysis in Rosales Justo v. Sessions persuasive. 895 F.3d 154 (Ist Cir. 2018). In Rosales Justo, the First Circuit distinguished the Mexican government’s willingness to investigate crime from its ability to protect its citizens from harm, Id. at 163-64. There, the court determined that the police’s investigative efforts into the applicant's son’s murder was not alone sufficient to demonstrate the government’s ability to protect the applicant from harm in light of country conditions evidence showing the failure of police to protect Mexican citizens from organized crime, Jd, at 164. Here, the evidence in the record demonstrates that the Guatemalan government is unable to control violence against women or protect Respondent from abuse. Although the country conditions evidence reflects that the Guatemalan government has taken steps to combat gender violence, such as enacting several laws to combat violence against women, impunity for violence against women remains a serious problem throughout Guatemala, See Exh. 3, Tab K 199-200, 277-81. Guatemala has one of the highest rates of femicide in the world. Id. at 379. This is “attributable to widespread inefficacy and bias in the Guatemalan justice system. Id, at 199-200, 274, 296-302. Notably, “police had minimal training or capacity to investigate sexual crimes or assist survivors of such crimes, and the government did not enforce the law effectively.” Id, at 199, ‘The police also often fail to respond to requests for assistance in domestic violence situations and sometimes engage in outward discrimination against women. Id. at 200. Additionally, “[iJhere is also a pattern of prosecutors and judges urging conciliation of conflicts, rather than seeking to protect victims of domestic violence. Even in cases where the courts successfully prosecute and convict perpetrators of domestic violence, commutable sentences render protection illusory.” Id, at 274, Indigenous women face even further obstacles because they do not speak Spanish and live in remote areas of the country without access to the police in their villages. Id, at 302. Notably, even when @ woman is able to travel to the police, she may be unable to communicate with the police. Id. Respondent’s personal experiences in Guatemala are consistent with the country conditions reports. Indeed, she testified that she reported dammdgjamilie abuse to the police on multiple occasions during the course of their eighteen year relationship. On almost every occasion, the 4 police or other government actors merely told Mwsjumigip that he should not hit Respondent or that he should divorce Respondent, but did not otherwise take any actions to protect Respondent from demmigmiigg's abuse. Notably, despite Respondent’s several complaints of domestic abuse, the police arrested SRE on only one occasion during which they ordered him to stay away from-Respondent. Yet, despite his significant history-of abuse, the-police only detained him for five days. After he was released, dasa returned to the home he shared with Respondent and within two days resumed his abusive conduct; thereby demonstrating, the general ineffective nature of the police’s singular act to protect Respondent, The Court acknowledges that Respondent did not report AAMIBMMENBs subsequent abuse, but instead decided to end their relationship and that Memjmmilap complied with her request by moving out of their shared home. However, NSISW¥0™Bs decision to end his relationship with Respondent does not appear to have been taused by any actions on the part of the government to protect Respondent. Indeed, the government’s single act to arrest MENGE for five days, over the course of his eighteen years of violent abusive conduct against Respondent, had no effect on his behavior as he returned to her home after that arrest and continued his violent actions against Respondent. Moreover, as discussed, Respondent suffered several years of abuse at the hands (QM, prior to his arrest and the termination of their relationship, which was due to her gender, and for which the government did not protect her. In light of the aforementioned evidence, the Court finds that the Guatemalan government was unable to contro! SIINMMIiiilg or protect Respondent from his abuse. B. Presumption of Future Persecution Respondent established that she experienced past persecution on account of her membership in a PSG at the hands of an actor the Guatemalan government is unable or unwilling to control. Therefore, she benefits from a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, See 8 CER. § 1208.16(b)(1). To overcome this presumption, DHS bears the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances ‘suctr that the-applicant-no- longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in her country of nationality on account of a protected ground; or (2) the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of her country of nationality and under the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect her to do so. See Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 451 (BIA 2008) (remanding for failing to shift the burden of proof to DHS that, by a preponderance of the evidence, relocation was reasonable); see also 8 C.F.R. § § 1208.13(b)(1)((A)-B), ()G)Gi). Here, DHS argues that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Respondent is no longer at risk of harm fromaiN—WWilimilip because: (1) she has ended her relationship withadsmmiijembiap, (2) has not suffered harm from him since 2015, despite having resided in Guatemala for eight months in 2015 prior to her travel to the United States, and (3) has not communicated with him since 2015. See supra §ILB. DHS alternatively contends that Respondent could reasonably avoid future harm from MgamaiewwaNp by moving to a village called Choain where she has several extended relatives. See supra § ILB. However, for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that DHS has not rebutted the presumption. First, although Respondent has ended her relationship with SQ§MMININMIMBp, docs not communicate with him, and has not been harmed by him since 2015, the record reflects that he is still interested in harming Respondent. Notably, Respondent revealed that while he has not communicated withther, he has communicated several violent threats to harm her to her parents in Guatemala__Specifically, in- 2018, SEER ores Respondent's~parents~for~ allowing —— Respondent to leave Guatemala and warned them that he was “going to get her” if she ever returns to Guatemala. See supra § IL.B. Respondents sister further details in her affidavit tha has learned that Respondent is in immigration proceedings and has professed his desired to harm her upon her return to Guatemala, See Exh. 2, Tab D at 19, Furthermore, as discussed supra, the country conditions evidence reveals that violence against women continues to remain a serious problem in Guatemala and the police do not effectively enforce the laws to protect women against ham, Exh. 2, Tab G; Exh, 3, Tab K, Accordingly, the Court does not find that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Respondent would not be at risk of harm from im SMM vpon her return to Guatemala, Next, while Respondent has family in the village of Choain, this village is only thirty sninutes walking distance from where Respondent resided in Guatemala, Thus, moving from ler Hometown to the village Choain would not be a safe alternative to where she previously reside, as it is entirely possible or even likely that Respondent could encounter QM in Choain due its close proximity to where they resided together. Moreover, Respondent is an indigenous woman with no education, speaks very limited Spanish, and has no family ties in any other area of Guatemala that diamiammigie could not easily reach Respondent, Additionally, DHS has not presented any evidence detailing any manner in which Respondent could be able to move to another part of Guatemala considering her aforementioned unique circumstances. See 8 CF.R. § 1208.13(6)(3) (noting that economic and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties are factors to be considered regarding the reasonableness of internal relocation), Therefore, the Court does not find that DHS has met its burden to show that Respondent could escape harm by reasonably relocating within Guatemala, ccordingly, the Court finds that DHS has not rebutted the presumption that Respondent “has a future fear of persecution om account of her membership in a particular social group, namely Guatemalan women. Therefore, the Court finds that she is statutorily eligible for asylum.\"" d. Discretion An applicant who establishes statutory eligibility for asylum also bears the burden of demonstrating that she merits a grant of asylum as a matter of discretion. See INA § 208(b)(1)(A). Tn determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, both favorable and adverse factors should be considered, Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467, 473 (BIA 1987), including adverse factors such as “the circumvention of orderly refugee procedures,” A-B-, 27 I&N Dee. at 345 n.12, and humanitarian factors, such as age, health, and family ties, H-, 21 1&N Dec. at 348. The danger * Because the Court has concluded that “Guatemalan Women” is a cognizable PSG and that she has an unrebutted presumption of future persecution on account of her membership in that group, the Court need not analyze whether hr other proffered PSGs are cognizable. See LN.S. v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S, 24,25 (1976) (“Asa general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.” 16 of persecution should outweigh all but the most egregious adverse factors:Pula, 19 I&N Dee. at 473. Here, the negative discretionary factors are that Respondent entered the United States without inspection and traveled through Mexico prior to arriving in the United States. Exh. 1; Exh. 2, Tab Bat 9. However, since her arrival in the United States, she has attended all of her immigration hhearings-and has-not committed any-criminal-offenses. Furthermore; it eppears-that-she merely— traveled through Mexico, does not have any ties to that country, and was not offered any immigration benefits or protection in that country. Therefore, considering the risk of harm facing Respondent in Guatemala and the absence of any major adverse factors, the Court finds that Respondents case merits a favorable exercise of discretion. C. Conclusion ‘The Court finds that Respondent established past persecution on account of her thembership in a particular social group in Guatemala and that she has a presumption of a well- founded fear of future persecution if she returns to that country. Additionally, Respondent established that she merits asylum as a matter of discretion. Therefore, the Court grants Respondent asylum pursuant to INA § 208, V. Withholding of Removal under the Act and CAT As the Court grants Respondent asylum under INA § 208, the Court does not reach Respondent's application for withholding of removal pursuant to INA § 241(b)(3) or her request for protection under CAT. VI. Respondent Greysi @ammi, Respondent’s minor child, was included as a derivative beneficiary of Respondent's Form 1-589. See Exh. 2, Tab B at 4. The child of an alien who is granted asylum, if not otherwise eligible for asylum, may be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying ‘Such alien. See INA § 208(b)(3).

In ane occasion, one. gang member approached Respondent, put a gun to her stomach, and said he had never been with a pregnant woman before. Respondent began to cry and begged him to let her go.- The gang rhentiber let Respondent go, but told her that she wotild not escape next time. Mara'l8 garig members watched Respondent’s house closely and knew she did not have a male figure in her home to protect her from harassment and violence. Respondent moved to Suichitoto for approximately one year, but retumed to La Union because they were threatened and fold to leave by a rival gang.

Asylum ‘Any individual who is physically present in the United States, intespective of status, may receive asylum, in the exercise of discretion, provided she filed a timely application and qualifies as a refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act. INA § 208. An alien bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum. Naizgi v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir. 2006); INA § 208(6)(1)(B)(D; 8 CFR. § 1208.13(@). To establish asylum eligibility under the Act, the applicant must show that she was subjected to past persecution or that she has a “well-founded” fear of future persecution “on acéount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”-.8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1).- An alien who establishes past persecution is entitled, to a rebuttable presumption that she, has-a well-founded fear of future persecution. Jd. Absent past persecution, an applicant may independently establish a well-founded fear of persecution, Ngarurih v. Asheroft, 371 F.3d 182, 187 (Ath Ci. 2004). A. Credibility and Corrobaration When testimony is offered in support of an application for relief, the Immigration Court must determine whether such testimony. is credible. INA § 240(c)(4)(B). For applications filed afier May 11, 2005, the provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005 govern the credibility analysis. In making a credibility determination, the Immigration Court considers the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors. See id. § 240(c)(4)(C); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 1&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 2007), Generally, to be credible, testimony should satisfactorily explain any material discrepancies or omissions. INA § 240(c)(4)(C). ‘The Immigration Court may base a credibility determination on the witness’ demeanor, candor, or responsiveness, and the inherent plausibility of her account. INA § 240(c)(4)(C). Other factors include the consistency between written and oral statements, without regard t@ whether an inconsistency goes tothe heat ofthe Applicant's claim, 1d; J-¥-C-, 24 1&N Dee. at 263-66. ‘Where itis reasonable to-¢xpect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifigs of an applicant's elaim, such evidence should be provided.

Furthermore, an applicant should provide documentary support for material facts that are central toher claim and easily subject to verification. S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 725. Considering the record as a whole, the Court finds Respondent's testimony to be credible. See INA § 240(0\\(4(C). Respondent testified candidly and provided a sufficiently detailed, piausible, and intemally consistent accounts ofthe events in El Salvador that prompted Respondents’ departures and fear ofretum. Respondent’s testimony jvas consistent with documentary evidence submitted in support of Respondents’ applications. See|generally Exhibit 3, Tabs B-L. | B. One Year Time Bar | ‘An alien applying for asyhini must show “by clear and conviricing evidence that the application has been filed within one year after the date of the alien’s artival in the United States.” INA §208(a)(2)(B). Respondent entered the United States on or about August 22, 2016. Exhibit 1, “Respondent filed her asylum pplication on August 18, 2017. Exhibit 2. Accordingly, the Court finds that Respondent at filed her application. C. Past Persecution i Persecution constitutes a requisite degree of harm that rises above “mere harassment,” Li v, Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir. 2005); see also Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), and occurs at the hands of the applicant's government or an agent the government is unwilling or unable to control, see Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 128 (4th Cir. 2011); Acosta, 19 I8N Dec. at 222. a. Past Harm The past harm Respondent suffered rises to the level of persecution. Respondent testified credibly to being approached and sexually harassed two separate times by Mara 18 gang members. In one occasion, while Respondent was pregnant with her son, the gang member placed a gun on stomach and attempted to rape her... Additionally, Respondent and her mother were bound and robbed inside their home.. Further, Respondent testified that during her temporary relocation within El Salvador, she was harassed and threatened by rival. gang members in Suitchitoto. These incidents, in the aggregate, rise beyond mere harassment to the level of persecution. Matter of O- Z- and I-Z-, 22 1&N Dec. 23 (BIA 1998). These incidents'rise to the level of persecution. See Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784; F. 3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (“[W]e have expressly held that “the threat of death qualifies as pefsecution.””) (citing Crespin-Valladares, 632 F.3d at 126). The Court next considers whether the harm Respondent suffered occurred at the hands of an agent or agents the Salvadoran government -was unable or unwilling to control. 4. . Government Unwilling or Unable to, Control Respondent has demo: the Salvadoran government was unable or unwilling to protect her from his past persecution. Respondent testified that she did not report the death threats and sexual harassment she received to the police because she believes many Salvadoran police officer are corrupt and cooperat zi gang members. Respondent testified that one police officer lived on her street. The police officer never offered to assist Respondent, even knowing that gang members were watching her home, entered her home and bound Respondent and-her mother. Nevertheless, even assuming the Salvadoran government. was, willing-to protect Respondent, independent documentary eviderite demonstrates it would have been unable to do.so. Country conditions evidence strongly supports Respondent's assertion that the Salvadoran government was unwilling or unable to protect her from his persecutors, . Exhibit 3, Tabs F-K. According to the U.S. Department of State’s 2017 ‘Human Rights Report for El Salvador, principal humen rights problems stemmed from widespread extortion and other crime in poor communities throughout the country, See 2017 El Salvador Country Reports at 31._ Other human rights issues included. “widespread corruption; weak rule. of law, which contributed. to high levels of impunity and government abuse, including unlawful killings by security forces, discrimination, and delay and lack of compliance with court rulings[.]” Jd at 12. There were reports of security force involvement in unlawful or extfajudicial killings, including fifty-three possible cases being investigated by the attorney general. Jd. The U.S. Department of State also reports that in many neighborhoods, armed groups and gangs targeted certain persons, interfered with privacy, family, and home life, and created a climate of fear that authorities were unable of restoring to normal. Id. Gangs interfered with freedom of fpovement for Salvadoran persons due to the strength of criminal gang activity: || Each gang had its dwn controlled territory. Gang members did not allow persons living in another gang’s controlled area to enter their territory, even when travelling in public transportation. Gangs forced (persons to, present identification cards (that contain their addresses) to determine where they lived. If gang members discovered that a person lived in a rival gang’s territory, that person might be killed, beaten, or not allowed to enter the territory. Bus companies paid extortion fees to operate within gang, tertitories, . often. paying. numerous fees for the different areas in which they operated. The extortion costs were passed on to paying customers. Id. at 16. Country conditions evidence demonstrates the Salvadoran government has been unable or unwilling to protect Respondent from her persecutors: Mara 18 gang members. Further, country conditions evidence indicates that violence against women— including rape and other forms of sexual violence—is widespread and, pervasive in E! Salvador, yet largely uncontrolled by the Salvadoran government. See id at 21-24. The vast majority of sexual crimes go unpunished. Id. As of July 2017, a total of 18,658 women “had been victims of sexual-related crimes and 63 defendants had been convicted for|sexual-related crimes against women.” Id. at 21. Further, gang members often enjoy impunity for the crimes they commit. Jd. Because Respondent suffered harm rising to the Ievel of persegution at the hands of agents the Salvadoran government was unable or unwilling to control, the Court finds Respondent suffered past persecution. The Court next considers whether Respondeit suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. D. Statutory Grounds ‘The Court ‘finds that ‘Respondent has established that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected. ground if she is returned to El. Salvador. To satisfy the statutory test for asylum, an applicant must make'a two-fold-showing. She must demonstrate the presence of a protected ground, and she must-link the feared.persecution, atleast in part, to it. Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir. 2005); Cordova v. Holder, 759 F.3d 332, 337 (4th Cis. 2013) (citation omitted). a. Political Opinion |, Respondent claims she'is statutorily eligible for asylum on account of lier imputed political opinion “to oppose the Mara ie in the case of relocation to MS-13 tertitory-in the future if necessary.” Resp’t Brief at 19:5 The Court notes that resistance to gang violence does notestablish a political opinion, Matter of S-E-G:, 24 1&N Dec. 579,589 (BIA 2008). ‘The Court finds that Respondent has not met her burden of establishing hier political opinion. Respondent has not shown that her resistance to gang control and domination are-politically motivated or that a political opinion has been imputed|to her. “[W]hatever behavior an applicant seeks to advance as political, it must be motivated by an ideal or conviction of sorts before it will constitute grounds for asylum. Because of this requirement, “fears of ‘retribution over purely personal matters or general conditions of upheaval and unrest do not constitute cognizable bases for granting asylum.”” Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, 402 F.36 at 466 (quoting Belbruno v, Ashérofi, 362 F.3d 272, 284 (4th Cir. 2004) (other citations omitted), b. Particular Social Group Under the REAL ID Act, an alien’s membership in a particular social group must be “at east one central reason for persecuting the applicant” to establish their eligibility for one of the five protected grounds for asylum, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i) (emphasis added); Oliva v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 53 (4th Cir. 2015); accord Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d at 127. Incidents of harm that are consistent with acts of private violence, or merely show a person has been the victim of criminal activity, do riot constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. Huaman-Cornelio v, BIA, 979 F.24 995, 1000 (4th Cir. 1992), Although the Act does not define the phrase “particular social, group,” the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has established three requirements for .group-to be cognizable under the Act: (1) group members must share a common, immutable characteristic; (2) the group must be defined with sufficient particularity; and GB) the group must have adequate] social distinction. Matter. of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208, 212, 214-18 (BIA 2014); Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dee. at 233. Respondent claims she is Statutorily. eligible for asylum based on her membership in two particular social groups she defined as “single El Salvadoran mothers” or alternatively “El Salvadoran female heads of household.” Resp’t Brief at 8, 10. Jn a light most favorable to Respondent, the Court considered the more apt particular social group of “single Salvadoran mothers who lack male protectioy.” For the following reasons, the Court finds this subsequent delineation of Respondent's particular social group is cognizable. i Immutability Immutable characteristics! are those attributes that members of the group “either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.” Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at.233. Sex, color, kinship, and shared past experiences are prototypical examples of an immutable characteristic that can form the basis of a particular social group. Id. Here, membership in the particular social. group of “Single Salvadoran mothers * Averments of counsel contained in a egal bret are arguments, and.not evidence, Matter of Ramires-Sancher, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). ] who lack male protection” is immutable because members cannot change or should not be required to change their status as “single,” “Salvadoran,” and “mothers.” ” Respondent's social_ group satisfies the immutability requirement because it is defined by gender, nationality, and familial status, See Acosta, 19 1&N Dee. al 233; Cece v, Holder, 733 F.3d 662, 669 (7th Cir. 2013) (finding that a woman’s decision to remain tinmarried is an immutable characteristic).* Respondent became a mother when she became pregnant with her son, During Respondent's pregnancy, a Mara 18 gang member approached Respondent, placed a gun to her’storiiach, told her that he had never been with a pregnant women before, and that next time she would not be able to escape him. Accordingly, the Court finds the social group satisfies the immutability requirement. it, Parteserdp A particular social group must also have a clearly defined discrete boundary of who is member of the group. Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I8N Dec. 227, 239 (BIA 2014) (“A particular social group must be defined by haracteristics that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group.”) (citation omitted). The primary focus of the particularity requirement is that the group's boundaries must be easily delimited and verified in the society in question. ; Temu v. Holder, 740 F.3d 887, ‘395 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding that a social group must have identifiable boundaries to meet the particularity element); see also Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 214, Additionally, the group must “not be amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective.” M- E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 239. Respondent's proposed social. group is limited by the. clear terms “single,” “Salvadoran,” “mothers,” and who lack male protection.” - The members of this group are limited to those who possess|all fotir of these characteristics. The proposed social group is precisely defined, and is not atflorphous or overbroad. . Therefore it meets the particularity requirement of the particular social group definition, ii. Social Distinetion ‘The final element of a patticular social group is that it is sufficiently socially distinct to constitute a recognized class of petsons within the applicant’s society. .M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 237; Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951, 959 (BIA 2006) (stating that sex or family relationships are easily recognizable as particulir social groups). To meet this requirement, the applicant must provide evidence that “society in general perceives, considers, or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group.” W-G-R-, 26 I&N.Deo. at 217. The Court finds that the evidence in the record demonstratps that Salvadoran society makes meaningful distinctions based on the characteristics that comprise Respondent’s social group. See id.-Notably, the record shows that there is a high level of violeilce committed against Salvadoran women. Domestic violence, rape, and other sexual crimes are| widespread. See 2017 El Salvador Country Reports at 21-24. ‘The Salvadoran government has made efforts to combat-violence against women by creating specialized courts for violence against women. Id. at 22-23. These efforts demonstrate the government's position that Salvadoran women need:specialized protection and thus, that they are viewed as a distinct group from the general population in-E} Salvador. .See Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 586-87., Having foulld that “single Salvadoran mothers who lack male protection” is, © The Court recognizes that eases fro as persuasive authority. However, the: before this Court, er circuits hold no binding precedential value and can orly be considered fenth Circuits discussion provides a useful aid in considering similar factors immutable, particular, and socially distinct, the Court finds that i s a cognizable particular social group under the Act.” Nexus | ° ‘The applicant must also show that her meibership in’the parti¢ular social group was at least “one central reason” for the persecution she suffered. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i). Thus, a protected ground must be at least one central reason for the persecution. Cordova v. Holder, 759 F.3d at 337, A central reason i one that is more than “ificidental, tangential, superficial, o subordinate to another reason forjharm.” Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Matter of J-B-N-, 24 I&N Dec. 208; 214 (BIA 2007)). ‘The applicant may provide either direct or circumstantial evidence to establish that the persecutor was or would be motivated by her actual or imputed status or belief. See INS. v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992). Respondent has provided sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to establish that her membership in that social group was at least one central reason for the persecution she suffered. See id. The attempted rape, sexual harassment, extortion, and threats perpetrated on Respondent isnot unique. Salvadoran gang members are known to sexually assault and enslave women in order to extort money, terrorize communities and suppress opposition. See 20/7 El Salvador Country Report at 21-24. This is representative of commonly held patriarchal views in El Salvador where sexual violence directed at women is widespread. See id. Further, the common nature and impunity of sexual violence against women allows gang members to abuse women without fear. See id. Even when violence against women is reported, convictions are rare. See id. While the Court notes Respondent was persecuted by the gangs for extortion, Respondent's pregnancy, status as a mother, and the lack of male protection was a central reason for her persecution. See Matter of J-B-N-, 24 I&N Dee. at 214. ‘The country. conditions evidence further establishes that Respondent is particularly vulnerable in El Salvador as a single Salvadoran mother without male protection. See generally Exhibit 3, Tabs F-L. The nature afid frequency of the violence against women indicates an animus that is specifically directed toward] women in El Salvador. Id. Respondent testified Mara 18 gang members constantly watched her home and requested money from her. Respondent testified the Mara 18 gang members knew that Respondent lived in a house without male protection. Respondent further testified that the gang members. watched everyone's house and specifically targeted homes without male figures and the gang members prayed on the female's vulnerability. Respondent explained that one-of her neighbors, who also did not have a male living in her household, was targeted and consequently murdered for not paying extortion money to the gangs. ‘The fact that the gang used these| traits in determining that Respondent was vulnerable indicates, that Mara 18 gang members specifically targeted her beoause of her characteristics that she maintains as a part of her social gioup. Respondent credibly testified that in one occasion a Mara 18 gang member persecuted hey, because she was pregnant—a mother. The: gang member specifically told Respondent that ihe had never been-with a pregnant woman, and proceeded to attempt to rape Respondent. Furthermore, because Mara 18 gang members specifically targeted 7 Because the Court finds that Respondent was persecuted on the basis of being a single Salvadoran mother who lacks male protection, it need not examine oat particular social groups. a 8 Respondent and other women Respondent knows with the same distinguishing characteristics, the Court finds that the gang targeted Respondent for something more than a general criminal purpose. Thus, if Respondent had not been|a single Salvadoran mother-without male protection, the gang would not have attempted to raped|her; as such, Respondents particular social group was “at least one central reason” for her persecution. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(). E, _ Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Respondent benefits from t rebuttable presumption of future persecution, Thus, the Court analyzes whether DHS has indeed rebutted Respondent's presumption of future persecution by demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Resporident’s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of a protected ground; or (2) that Respondent could avoid a future threat to her life or freedom by reasonably relocating to another part of El Salvador. DHS has not submitted persuasive evidence of fundamental changed circumstances in El Salvador, such that Respondent's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of a protected ground. Although there is some evidence tos Salvadoran government's renewed efforts to combat gang ‘The Court finds DHS oT rebutted Respondent's presumption of future persecution. violence, documentary evidence demonstrates the persistence of gang violence and corruption within El Salvador. See e,g., Exhibit 3, Tabs F-L, HS also failed to show there is a reasonable intemal seiccation alternative available to Respondent. Although DHS argues-Respondents could internally relocate because they lived Suchitoto for approximately one year, Respondent credibly testified gang members eventually earned of her presence there when she had to leave the house to take her son to the hospital. Additionally, she stated she could not live anywhere in El Salvador because Mara 18 has a countrywide presence, and therefote, gang members would learn of her return. Country conditions evidence supports this assertion.. Moreover, even assuming there are communities in El Salvador in which Respondent may avoid Mara 18 detection, DHS failed to address the reasonability of such relocation options. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(3) (listing factors to consider when assessing the reasonableness of internal relotation). In addition, the threats to Respondent’s life are from a group of criminal individuals that the government of El Salvador is unwilling or unable to control. See Matter of S-A-, 22 1&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000). A. stable government’s mere “difficulty” in controlling private actors” conduct is not necessarily indicative of an inability to do so. . Matter of McMullen, 17 1&N Dec. 542, 546 (BIA 1980). However, ¢ven where a government displays @ willingness to control the private actors, such as gangs, the Sefficacy of those efforts” must also be examined to determine the government's ability. See Madrigal v. Holder, 716 F.3d 499, 506 (9th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added). Although Respondent did not report to the police the extortion and harassment against her and her family, the Court finds that she did report some. violence,.and her lack of reporting does not preclude her from cere Exhibit 3, Tabs F-L,- Respondent testified that she could not call the police out of fear of further harm by gang members. Failure to report the actions ot threats of the private actors to, the government does not preclude an applicant's claim if the applicant can show that goin to tie police would be futile or subject him to a greater risk of harm. | i . 9 i Matter of S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328, Documentary evidence demonstrates the persistent. and pervasive’ corruption and gang cdliusion within Salvadoran police and security forces. See generally Exhibit 3, Tabs F-L. Thus, Respondents fear that she would be further harmed by gangs fot filing a police report does not preclude her claim. Accordingly, the Court finds that Respondent has met her burdlen to show she teets the criteria for ‘refugee status and is'eligible for asylum. Naizgi v. “Gonzales, 455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir. 2006); INA § 2086)Q)(B)G); 8 CER. § 1208.13(@).

Hofstre Law Clinic Assistant Chief Counsel 108 Hofstra University 290 Broadway Hempstead, NY 11549 ‘New York, NY 10007 DECISION AND ORDERS OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE I PROCEDURAL HISTORY respondent’) is a male, native and citizen of El Salvador. Exhibit (Exh) 1. He alleges entry into the United Stetes (“U.S,”) at an unknown place on July 12, 2006. Exh, 3. On September 15, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (the Department” or “DHS\"") served a Form 1-862, Notice to Appear (*NTA”), upon the Varick Immigration Court, charging respondent with removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6\\(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA”), as an alien present in the U.S. without admission or parole, or who arrived in the U.S. at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. This commenced removal proceedings against respondent. Ia. While in: DHS custody, respondent filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained from him during his encounter with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office and shared with DHS on August 9, 2017, as well as any additional evidence arising from the allegedly itlegally obtained evidence 1 CMTS\""). DHS opposed suppression. On December 1, 2017, a prior Immigration Judge denied respondent's motion to suppress the aforementioned information and terminate these proceedings. Respondent filed an interlocutory appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA” ot “Board”. The Board declined to address the appeal by order dated March 7, 2018, Respondent renewed that motion before the instant court following his release from DHS custody and change of venue. tthe December !, 2017, respondent filed an admittedly untimely Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (“asylum application”), including a claim for withholding of removal under Article II of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (°CAT”) with the Varick Immigration Court. The Court found Respondent removable as charged, based on evidence filed by DHS. id Removability was therefore established by clear and convincing evidence, See INA § 240(c)(2)(B). Respondent declined to designate a country of removal. The court, upon the Department's recommendation, designated BI Salvador for that purpose, Following his release from custody, respondent appeared before this court on February 26, 2020, for a merits hearing. For the reasons that follow, respondent’s motion to suppress and terminate will be denied. His asylum application will be granted. Il, MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND TERMINATE A motion to suppress is used to challenge admissibility of evidence and may be granted ‘when it is supported by a specific and detailed statement based on personal knowledge that establishes a prima fucie case for suppression, Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dee. 609, 611 (BIA 1988). To set forth a prima facie case, the applicant bears the burden to assert a basis for suppression and must enumerate the articles to be suppressed. Matter of Wong, 13 1&N Dec. 820, 821-22 (BIA 1971); see also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 1&N Dec, 503, 505 (BIA 1980); Matter of Tang, 13 1&N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971). Ifthe affidavit is such that the facts alleged, if true, could support « basis for excluding the evidence in question, then the claims must also be supported by testimony. fd. at 611-12 (emphasis added); Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 125 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Maldonado v. Holder, 763 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2014) (If a respondent “provide[s] an affidavit that, faken as true, ‘could support a basis for excluding the evidence,” the respondent “is entitled to ‘an opportunity to confirm those allegations in an evidentiary hearing.” ); see also Cotzojay v. Holder, 725 F.3d 172, 179 (2d Cir. 2013). If.a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to DHS to justify the manner in which it obtained the evidence at issue, Matter of Burgos, 15 I&N Dee, 278, 279 (BIA 1975). DHS’s failure to justify the conduct of its agents resolves the issue in favor of suppression. Matter of Tang, 13 1&N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971). A. Fourth Amendment Violation Generally, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply in removal proceedings unless the alleged violations are so “egregious” as to “transgress notions of fundamental fairness” the use of that evidence would violate the Fifth Amendment requirement of due process. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040-51 (1984); Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 124 (2d Cir, 2018). Consequently, evidence obtained pursuant to an egregious Fourth Amendment violation can be suppressed under the Fifth Amendment. Melnitsenko v, Mukasey, $17 F.3d 42, 47-48 (2d Cit. 2008). In the Second Circuit, suppression may be warranted under the Fourth Amendment when the evidence indicates “either (a) that an egregious violation that was fundamentally unfair has occurred, or (b) that the violation—regardless of its egregiousness or unfaimess—undermine(s] the reliability of the evidence in dispute.” Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 441 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Almeida-Amaral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2006)); Zuniga-Perez, 897 F.3d at 124. The first prong, set forth in Rajah and Almeida-Amaral, implicates the Fifth Amendment in that suppression is only warranted when evidence is obtained pursuant to an egregious Fourth Amendment violation which “transgyess{es} the fundamental notions of “fair play” that animate the Fifth Amendment.” Rajah, 544 Fi3d at 441; Matter of Toro, 17 1&N Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980) (egregious Fourth Amendment violation may render evidence inadmissible under the due process clause); Matter of Garcia, 17 1&N’Dec. 319, 320 (BIA 1980) (holding that statements given Woluntarily should be suppressed under the due process standard); see, e.g., United States v. Isiofia, 370 F.3d 226, 234-35 (2d Cir. 2004) (suppressing evidence of defendant's identity because he had not given voluntary consent for search of his home, where his passport was seized); ‘Meinitsenko, $17 F.3d at 47-48 (finding no Fourth Amendment violation where petitioner was stopped by DHS 107 miles from the Canadian border and interrogated, fingerprinted, and photographed for three hours with no Miranda warnings); Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 179 (finding that Petitioner had established a prima facie case of non-consensual warrantless entry into his home by ICE officers and that the ICE officers’ alleged conduct amounted to egregious Fourth Amendment violation). ‘The Second Circuit has cautioned that “the egregiousness of a constitutional violation cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the validity (or invalidity) of the stop, but must also be based on the characteristies and severity of the offending conduct.” Zuniga-Perez v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 114, 124 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Almeida-Amaral, 461 F.3d at 235). Factors to consider in determining whether that there was an egregious violation include “whether the violation was intentional; whether the seizure was gross or unreasonable, and without plausible legal ground; ‘whether the invasion involved threags, coercion, physical abuse or unreasonable shows of force; and whether the seizure or arrest was based on race or ethnicity.” Id. (quoting Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 182) (internal quotation marks omitted). A seizure may be an egregious violation, even when it is not “especially severe,” if the seizure was “based on race (or some other grossly improper ration).” Zuniga-Perez, 897 F.3d at 124 (quoting Cotzojay, 725 F.3d at 181). However, jurisdictional identity evidence, such as an individual’s name, is not suppressible under the Fourth Amendment, even if it was obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation, Lopez-Mendoza, 468 USS, at 1039-40; Pretzantzin, 725 F.3d at 650-51; Katris v. INS, 562 F.2d 866, 869 (2d Cir. 1977); see also Zerrei v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 342, 346 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding admission of copy of alien’s passport did not violate alien’s due process rights because the alien never objected to its submission and it was treated as authentic by alien's counsel); see also Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 1&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (finding that the “identity of an alien is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arvest.\""). In Pretzantzin v. Holder, the Second Circuit joined the Fourth, Eighth and Tenth Circuits in holding that Lopez~ Mendoza merely confirmed the long-standing jurisdictional rule that an unlawful arrest has no bearing on the validity of a subsequeftt proceeding; it did not create an evidentiary rule insulating spevific pieces of identity-related evidence from suppression. 725 F.34 641, 647 (2d Cir, 2013). Accordingly, the Second Circuit held that the BIA erred in concluding that the government had met its burden of establishing that cert@in alienage-related eviderice had been obtained independent of any constitutional violation. Pretsantzin, 736 F.3d at 652. B. Regulatory Violations ‘When an agency violates its own regulations prior tothe initiation of removal proceedings, the relevant inquiry is whether “DHS's error implicated a fundamental right.” Nolasco ». Holder, 637 F.3d 159, 165 @d Cit, 2011)., Pre-heating regulatory violations are not grounds for termination “absent prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience- shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.” Rojah, $44 F.3d at 447. Where a regulation was promulgated to protect a due process right, such as the “right ... to receive notice provided for in the NTA,” but “itis clear that the . .. alien received such notice, she has no due process claim, regardless of any technical defect in the manncr in which the NT‘ has been served.” Nolasco, 637 3d at 164, Where a regulatory violation does not affect a fundamental right, the proceeding should be invalidated only if petitioner shows that the “infraction affected cither the outcome or the overall fairness of the proceeding.” See Montero v, INS, 124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Waldron v, INS, 17 F.3d S11, $18 (2d Cir, 1993) (noting that, where no regulation violates a fundamental right, it “is best to invalidate a challenged proceeding only upon 1 showing of prejudice to the rights ‘sought to be protected by the subject regulation”). In the absence of such prejudice, termination would “place an unwarranted and potentially unworkable bburden on the government’s adjudication of immigration cases.” Waldron, 17 F.3d at 318, CC. Analysis : Respondent argues that he was subject to an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights during his late nightearly méming encounter with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office ('SCSO\"") at a bar called in Patchogue, New Yor Specifically, according to Respondent, the Suffolk County police officers, along with the ICE agents, egregiously violated his Fourth Amendment rights because he was detained and questioned along with the other patzans primarily due to their Latino heritage and their clothing. See MTS at 4-5. Therefore, any evidence and testimony obtained from the Respondent's arrest should be suppressed. See id. Respofdent indicates that he went to ME around 11:00 p.m. Exh. 2. Approximately 15 minutes later, 20 officers fiom the Suffolk County police department entered the bar and stated that they were looking for a known gang member and asked everyone. present for identification (“ID\""), 1d, Respondent gave them his Salvadoran identity card because the officers were not allowing ary @f the patrons fo leave without showing their IDs. Id. The police officers took respondent's ID,and asked him to speak to ICE agents who were standing outside of the bar. 1d, The agents questioned respondent about his work history, how often he patronized IEEE and how long he had been in the U.S. Jd, ‘The agents asked respondent if he was a gang member and asked hisn to remove his shirt so that they could look for tattoos. Id. They also took photographs of his uffper body. Id. Respondent was then sent back inside where hhe was again asked to temove his shigt, belt and shoes. [d, He was arrested by ICE around 3:00 ‘a.m. and put into an ICE van. Id. H@ was then informed that he was under arrest based upon his immigration status. Id. The ICE agests then further questioned him about that status, 1d. DHS argues that even thougiithe Suffolk County police officers did not have a warrant to inspect the bar in question, they {Gould do so because courts have long recognized that administrative inspections of closely;regulated businesses, such as bars and the liquor industry, fail within the rcasonable exceptiortto the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment. Respondent argues that the warranjless administrative inspections exception only applies to ‘commercial properties and does not @ircumvent Fourth Amendment privacy rights of individuals. Furthermore, an administrative inspeetion cannot be used as a pretext for a warrantless search. ‘The Court recognizes that respondent has presented some valid arguments regarding the scope of a warrantless search, Howeyer, he did not establish that he was detained along with the other patrons primarily because of his racial heritage. The background evidence submitted by DHS shows that law enforcement officials so because it was considered a public nuisance and was a known MS-13 hangout, See Exh, LA, tab E, The building itself was not structurally sound and was condemned after this incident. ‘The police themselves indicated to respondent that they were also looking for a particular gang member and released other patrons after they showed satisfactory identification documents, apparently regardless of their heritage. Further, while respondent assumes that all of the other patrons of the bar were of Latino heritage, there is no factual besis to support that assertion, Even assuming that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred because respondent wos not suspected of committing any crimeés*when Suffolk County police officers asked him for his identification and they did not have agyarrant to search for any specific individuals associated with the gang, the Court cannot conclude that any such violation was an egregious one, The growing presence of MS-13 poses a serious+danger to public safety in many parts of New York and especially on Long Isiand, in Suffat:County, Our society has a very real interest in addressing the problems posed by MS-13. Again, the background evidence also shows that (IEE along with another bar, was raided by law enforcement officers because of both administrative violations and known gang presence, Exh, 1A,Tab B, Cf. Rodriguez v. Barr, 943 F.3d 134 (2d Cir, 2019) (inference that the respondent's arrest was racially based where it occurred during a raid on a Hispanic neighborhood, in violation gf ICE policy and where officers’ comments revealed a racial animus as motivation for the raid). Akthe conclusion of the raids, both bazs were closed down and condemned, seven people were arrested on criminal charges and two were arrested by ICE agents for immigration violations. See id: Here, the evidence indicates that rather than targeting individuals of Latino heritage, law enforcement officers were targeting members of the MS-13. gang. While meny, if not most of the MS-13 gang members on Long Island may be of Latino heritage, the police would likely arré8t any known or suspected gang member, regardless of their ethnic heritage, * Respondent also argues that-DHS violated 8 C.P.R. § 287.8(6)(1), which states that immigration officers may pose quest{ins to anyone in consensual encounters as long as they do not restrain the freedom of the personfo walk away. DHS argues that Respondent has not provided any evidence to show that the ICE agents restrained his freedom. However, respondent indicates that the police officers kept his ID and/asked him to speak to ICE agents. It seems unlikely that someone in the Respondent’s situatiorwould think that it is reasonable to walk away from the ICE agents without first speaking to tha, such that a regulatory violation could have ocourred, Respondent also argues that ICE agents violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(b)(2), which allows immigration officers to briefly detain persons for fuestioning when they have a reasonable suspicion that the subject is an alien illegally in the U.S; | Respondent asserts that he was kept at the bar for several hours and was then arrested and plaép in ICE custody. Respondent did not establish that DHS violated this regulation because ICE,Agents were aware that he gave the police a Salvadoran ID card, which gave rise to a reasonable'suspicion that the Respondent could be in the U.S, without authorization or legal status. ? Novertheless, even if ICE agents did violate 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(b)(1), the Court does not find that termination is appropriate hee. Under Rajah, termination of proceedings is not warranted unless there is “prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience- shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.” d, ICE's conduet does not fall into any of these categories. Respondent was present ina bar, which police officers have identified as a public nuisance and a known hangout for MS-13 gang members, He gave the police officers his Salvadoran ID card when they demanded IDs from all of the bar patrons, Subsequently, the ICE, agents questioned him based on the’suspicion that he was in the U.S. without authorization. Respondent himself admitted that other patrons who were not suspected of violating any criminal ‘or immigrations laws were allowed to leave the bar after the police checked their IDs. Under these circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that even if there was any regulatory violation that it was sufficiently egregious to warrant suppression of any evidence or termination of the removal proceedings,’ Q HL ASYLUM, WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL AND CAT PROTECTION A. Summary of Claim The parties stipulated that reifondent filed a credible asylum claim. See Matter of Fefe, 20 I&N Dec. 116 (BIA 1989). Therefore, this summary is derived from the documentary record. Having made this finding, the Court declines to reach DHS's argument regarding independent evidence of respondent’ alienage. See eg, Matter of A-B-, 27 1 & N Dee, 316,340 (A.G. 2018) (where an asylum application is fundamentally flawed in one respect, the ifamigration judge need not consider remainder of claim). 6 y Ls Respondent indicates that he entered the US. in or about April of 2006. Exh. 6. Prior to his departure from El Salvador, he ang his family members were extorted and threatened by gang members. Exh. 4, Tab A. Respondent was also targeted by the gang for recruitment. His sister ‘was once beaten by gang members. n one occasion, respondent was stabbed in the stomach by a gang member who was extorting him, 7d, He did not seek medical treatment or report this stabbing to the police because he felt the police would not assist him. Respondent does not indicate in his most recent statement why he djd not apply for asylum within one year of his entry, although he experienced a stabbing shortly before his departure from El Salvador. Exh. 6, Respondent applied for asylurh after he was detained by DHS. He was motivated to do so because he learned while detained that he had been labeled a gang member by U.S. authorities,” Respondent also learned that a cous} of his, who had joined « gang, was killed shortly after he was deported to BI Salvador from the U.S. He also indicates that other members of his family ‘were targeted for extortion since he Game to the U.S., and his brother was threatened with a gun ‘when he moved back to El Salvador. Exh. 6, p. 8. No specific dates are provided for these latter two events, es Respondent is afraid to return to Bl Salvador because his attorneys told him that if he is deported, the U.S. government will inform Salvadoran officials that he is a gang member. Exh, 4, Tab A, p. 1. Many parties, including:the police, the military, vigilante groups and rivel gangs all wish to kill gang members. ° Resporident believes that no one can protect him in El Salvador ‘because many police and government officials are corrupt and work with the gangs. B. Expert Testimony ¥ Respondent presented the testimépy of an expert on country conditions in El Salvador, Dr. Thomas J, Boerman.? See Exh, 5. He'explained that E! Selvador is a country roughly the same size as the state of Massachusetts. It as approximetely 60-65,000 gang members and millions of sympathizers. ‘The country is divided between the MS-13 and Mara-18 gangs. Over the past twenty years, the Salvadoran government's response to gangs has been high high-profile, visible government poligy and logislation, known es the Mano Dura, or Iron Fist. It includes a police and military suppression strategy, and extensive, enhanced prison sentences. ‘According to Dr. Boerman, there is erimity and animosity between the police and military and the gangs, who kill each other “left ayd right,” but on the other hand they have a symbiotic relationship. The gangs are recognizéd as political actors, “tiptoeing around the edges,” and they can distupt raltis, intimidate voters, and terrorize neighborhoods in support ofa candidate or party. Clandestine negotiations and agreements between government officials and gangs cccur as well, Dr, Boerman opines that the:police cannot control the gangs in El Selvador becouse the necessary infrastructure does not exiit, The country has been ravaged by gang members, but at the same time the police and government are hyper-vigilant about gang presence, and violence is an integral pert of policing and law enforcement, ‘The police stop anyone they do not know, ee 2 This fear rising from being labeled as ape member inthe U.S. was not inched in respondents nial asylums application led with the court on Deceinbéf1, 2017. Exh. 3. > DHS did not challenge Dr. Boerman's qualification as an expert witness. particularly young to middle-aged mea, to threats or abuses, trip the individual to search for tattoos, and subject him According to Dr. Boerman, prbtocols exist between the U.S, and Salvadoran governments, such that the U.S. government alerts the Salvadoran government when a criminal deportee is returned to that country. Ifa criminal deportee returns to their former neighborhood, the residents become aware of the reftrn. If the deportee relocates to a new area, residents inquire about them. If an actual or su§pected gang member arrives in a certain area, the police will know of his presence, Ifa deportee is labeled as gonf affiliated by the U.S. government, for example if designaied as such on an I-213 form or through the U.S. embassy, that individual is subject to additional scrutiny at customs. cessing at the airport, and immigration and security forces may be involved. Dr. Boerman believes this is an “entirely appropriate” interview, which may become an interrogation, ‘The deportdeis questioned about gang affiliation and which items they ae bringing from the U.S. The individual is also fingerprinted and photographed. Once an individual gets past this legal dimensibin, the door is opened to extra-judicial problems. Dr. Boerman is familiar with several dozen incidents involving such problems. Dr. Boerman described Decree 717, a provision of Salvadoran law that requires returned Salvadorans labeled as members or collaborators of gangs or other illicit groups to register with the government, and provide their address. See Exh. 4, tab F, An individual can be taken into longterm custody for failing or refusing to comply. Dr. Boerman was not aware of exactly how an individual complies with the registration requirement; whether the deportee must go to @ police substation or to a parole-type office. Dr, Boerman believes that Salvadoran immigration authorities would initiate this process'and input the deportee’s information into a government computer system, such that the police'and military would be aware of the information. No protocol exists to purge gang membership from a government database, and if officers on the street believe that an individual is a gang member, the purging of that person's name from a database would not change that belief’ Gang members cannot function without a political agenda, They shape the sociopolitical climate through the use of terror and manipulation of the political system to gain relative assurances of their ability to operate. :They negotiate with political and police officials to establish the parameters of each paryis allowable actions. It is impossible to distinguish criminality trom polities, Dr. Boerman reviewed respondents written file, including the I-213, and spoke to respondent's counsel. He did not interview respondent himself. Dr. Boerman concludes that respondent’ life is at risk in E] Salvador because he was identified as a gang member in the U. Between 2014-2018 or so, the Salvadoran government reported almost 2,000 confrontations between gang members and the police. Approximately 1500 gang members were killed in the last several years, but this number dogs not include beatings, torture, and disappearances. The police do make reports regarding these incidents, but they are not investigated, Forensic teams remove the body and take it to # morgtie, but the number of killings that occur but are not reported is unknown, Longterm residents of the US are generally not seen as residents of El Salvador anymore, If respondent refuitns there and engages in activities a gang sees as a challenge, for example religious prostlytizing, that would put R in greater danger because he 4 would be seen as a stranger getting involved in gang activity.‘ ‘The Salvadoran government leaves individuals alone to deal with these problems, ‘The ability to relocate internally is a fallacy, as El Salvador is a small couiftry and the population is hypervigitant about who is present in the social environment, People are posted at the entrance to neighborhoods who monitor the ingress of every individual. If they encounter a stranger, they call a designated point of contact and then stop the entering individual to look for tattoos, and rob him of state- issued identity documents. ‘They then investigate the individual's identity, including from whence be hhas come. According to Dr. Boerman, the main concerns for respondent are the Salvadoran military and police, Gang members ate a secondary concern. An anti-gang political opinion ‘would endangers respondent only if he expressed that in a visible way. There are gated communities th El Salvador where respondent could live safely, but that lifestyle would require significant fitiancial resources. Respondent is unlikely to have access to such funds, Without them, he will likely live in a lower income area that is gang affected or gang controlled, A ‘On cross-examination, Dr. Boerman acknowledged that residents who “keep their heads down” and comply with extortion demands can be safe, but a person who is “on the gang’s radar” for whatever reason is exposed to particulatized risk. Dr. Boerman does not know how ‘many known or suspected gang members are ceported back to El Salvador every year, He was not aware if the U.S, government shafes the form I-213 itself with the Salvadoran government, rather than just the information on the document. There are two different information sharing protocols, but Dr. Boerman was not aware if there exists another particular document that would be shared. There are no statistis regarding the number of individual imprisoned for suspected gang membership who are tortured: but abuses are rampant, widespread and occur with impunity, 400-600 police officers are arrested for abuses every year, and the majority go back to work without charge, It would be impossible to conduct a study regarding how many individuals who like respondent returned to El Salvador after being identified as a gang member, were tortured or killed, such that no such statistics exist, C. Legal Standards i Asylum To be statutorily eligible for asylum, an applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is a refugee, which requires a showing of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(b)(I)(A); 8 CPLR. §§ 1208.13, 1240.8(4), If cligibility is determined, asylum may be granted in the exercise of disoretion. INA § 208(b)(1)(A}; INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423 (1987). * Respondent indicates that he is regular churchgoer inthe U.S., but did not assert religion as a basis for his ol ‘the most recent version of his asylum application. Exh 6, p. 5. 9 8. Credibility and Corroboration 2 In all applications for asylurs; the court must make a threshold determination of the applicant's credibility. Matter of O-Ds, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). Under the REAL ID Act, after considering “the totality,pf the evidence, and all relevant factors,” the court may base a credibility determination on: the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant; the inherent plausibility of the account; J the consistency between oral and written statements; the internal consistency of such statements; the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record; and any inaccuracy or falsehood in such statements, “without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falschood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim, or any other relevant factor.” INA § 208(b)(1)(B)\\(iii); see also Diallo v. U.S. Dep’ of Justice, 548 F.3d 232, 234 n.1 (2d Cir, 2008); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 1&N Dee. 260, 266 (BIA 2007). In addition, an applicant requesting asylum under INA § 208 bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion, Testimony that is credible, persuasive, and “refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee” may be sufficient to meet this burden of proof absent corroboration, INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i); see also 8 C.F.R, § 1208,13(a). However, Where the Immigration Judge determines that “the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such"
,"evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannit reasonably obtain the evidence.” INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(ii). ‘The court should provide an applicant who has not submitted reasonably available corroborating evidence, both an opportunity to explain the absence of such evidence and a continuance if he demonstrates good cause, Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 519 (BIA 2015). b. Statutory Eligibility ‘An asylum applicant may demonstrate that he is a “refugee” in either of two ways. First, he may demonstrate that he suffered:past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, ‘membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, INA §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(6(1)(A); 8 CPR. § 1208.13(b)(1). Second, he may demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution ‘on account of a protected ground by demonstrating that he subjectively fears persecution and that, his fear is objectively reasonable. INA § 101(a\\(42)(A); Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). ©. Past Persecution To establish past persecution; an asylum applicant must demonstrate that he suffered persecution in his country of nationality or, if stateless, in his country of last habitual residence, con account of a protected ground, and that he is unable or unwilling to return to, or avail himself of the protection of, that country’ because of such persecution. INA §§ 101(a)(42(A), 208(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1208,13(b)¢1). “Persecution” has generally been interpreted to include threats to life or freedom. Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec, 211, 222 (BIA 1985). “[It] is the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground,” and includes “non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse.” [vanishvili vy, U.S. Dep't of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To constitute persecution, threats typically must be “imminent,” “concrete,” or “so menacing as to 10 cause significant actual suffering or harm.” Ci Pan v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 449 F.3d 408, 412 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Guan Sham Liao v. U.S, Dep't of Justice, 293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 2002). Moreover, persecution must be inflicted by eithép the government or by a person or entity the government is. \\g or unable to control.” Maiter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dec. at 222; see also Pavlova v, LN.S., 441 F.3d 82, 91 2d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). In Martor of A-B-, though the Attorney General did not negate the possibility {hat violence inflicted by non-governmental actors may serve. as the basis for an asylum or withholding application based on membership in a particular social ‘group, he stated that outside “exceptional circumstances” such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address. 27 1&N Dec. 316, 317 (A.G: 2018). d. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution If past persecution is established, a regulatory presumption arises that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of his original claim. 8 C.P.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). ‘The Department may rebut this presumption if it demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant’s fear is no longer well-founded due to a fundamental change in circumstances or because the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that it would be reasonable to expeet him to do so. 8 CER. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)-Gi). e. Discretion . ‘An applicant who establishes statutory eligibility for asylum still bears the burden of demonstrating that he merits @ grant of asylum as a matter of discretion. INA § 208(b)(1)(A); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 428 1, 5 (noting that the Attorney General is not required to grant asylum fo everyone who meets the’ refugee definition). In determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, both favorable and adverse factors should be considered. ‘Mater of Pula, 19 [&N Dec. 467, 473-74 (BIA 1987) (superseded by regulation on other grounds). General humanitarian factors, such a age, health, or family ties, should also be considered in the exercise of discretion, Matter of H-, 24 1&N Dec. at 347-48; Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dec. at 474. In the absence of any adverse factors, asylum should be granted, Jd. at 474, In addition, the danger of persecution should outweigh all but the most egregious adverse factors. Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, 436 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir. 2006), IV, ANALYSIS A, Asylum-Timeliness Under INA § 208(a)(2)(B), itis the respondent's burden to show by clear and convineing evidence that he applied for asylum within one year of his last arrival in the U.S. Here, respondent claims to have entered the U.S. in oF about April 2006, and the asylum application was filed on December 1, 2017, after respondent was taken into DHS custody. Therefore, the application was admittedly untimely filed by over ten years. However, even if a respondent does not file within cone year of entry, he may still pursue an application for asylum if she shows either changed or extraordinary circumstances. INA‘§ 208(a)(2)D). An application must be filed within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the changed or extraordinary circumstances. Here, tespondent alleges that he filed his application within a reasonable time after he became aware that he had been labeled a gang member: by U.S. authorities. Respondent also learned while he was detained that a cousin of his, who had joined a gang, was killed shortly after he was deported to El Salvador from the U.S. : The latter reason is not sufficignt to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances, as respondent does not indicate when his. cousin was deported, or any details surrounding the killing, such as where and why it may have occurred, or the identity of the perpetrators. It is lacking in the details necessary to establish exactly how it relates to respondent’s asylum application. However, respondent becoming award that DHS had labeled him # gang member constitutes such a circumstance, as it created a new basis for him to fear persecution should he return to El Salvedor. Further, respondent filed within a reasonable period of time, less than four months, after learning that he had been labelled a gang meniber by DHS. Accordingly, he has met an exception to the. one-year filing deadline and his application for asylum will be considered on the merits, B, Credibility and Corrobordition ‘The parties stipulated that respondent filed a credible claim, ‘The court finds that Dr Boerman testified credibly. His testimony, as a whole, was specific, internally consistent, and consistent with his written statement and other documentary evidence. See INA § 208(b)(1\\(B\\Gii); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 &N Dee. at 266; Diallo, $48 F.3d at 234 n. 1, DHs made no specific challenge to his credibility either. C. Statutory Eligibility i Past Persecution Respondent did not establish that he suffered past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, To establish persecution on account of political opinion, the applicant must, demonstrate through direct or circumstantial evidence that the persecution is “on account of the vietim's political opinion, not the persecutor’s.” See INS v. Blias-Zacarias, $02 U.S. 478, 482 (1992) (emphasis in original); see also Castro v. Holder, 597 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir, 2010). ‘The Second Cireuit has explained that a political opinion does not necessarily mean the expression of an allegiance to a particular political group. Osorio v. LN.S., 18 F.3d 1017, 1030 (2d Cir. 1994). ‘An imputed political opinion can constitute a ground of persecution whether correctly or incorrectly attributed. See Vumi v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 150, 156 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Castro, 597 F.3d at 100. He contends that he was persecuted on account of his anti-gang political opinion, which he manifested by refusing to join the gang. Respondent, however, does not indicate that he expressed an anti-gang political opinion to them, other being unwilling to join them or be extorted by them, Exh. 4;tab A. He also did not establish that the gang imputed any opinion to him, other than his unwillingness to be recruited or subjected to the crime of extortion. ii, Well-Founded Fea.of Future Persecution As respondent did not establish past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, he does not benefit from: a: regulatory presumption of @ well-founded fear of future persecution and therefore continues’to bear the burden of proof, See 8 C.E.R. § 1208.13(b)(1) ‘The court finds that respondent met:that burden. 12 Respondent argues that he has an objectively well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a partjgular social group defined as “U.S. law enforcement labeled gang members.” The BIA has interprbted “particular social group” to mean a group with members who “share a common, immutable characteristic” that members cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences, See Matter of Acosta, 19 1&N Dee. 211, 233 (BIA 1985); Matter of Kasinga, 21 1&N Dec. 357, 365 66 (BIA 1996). Social groups must be classes recognizable by society at large, Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 336 (AG 2018). Moreover, the purported group must also exhibit a shared characteristic that is socially distinct’ within the society in questiah and defined with sufficient particularity.© Matter of M-E- V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014); Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208, 210-12 (BIA 2014); Paloka v. Holder, 762 F.3d 191, 196 (2d Cir. 2014), When assessing the particularity and social distinction of a putative social group, defining characteristics must be assessed in the social and cultural context of the applicant's country of citizenship or nationality. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee. at 241; see also W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dee. at 214-15. ‘The BIA held that the “particularity” requirement relates to the group’s boundaries or, as, carlier court decisions described it, the need to put ‘outer limits” on the definition of a ‘particular social group.\""” M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238, While neither cohesiveness nor homogeneity among group members is required, see Koudriachova v. Gonzales, 490 F.3d 255, 263 (2d Cir. 2007), particular social groups must be defined by conerete characteristies that provide a “clear benchmark for determining who falls-within the group,” and who does not. M-E-V-G-, 26 L&N Dec. at 239. “It is critical that the terms used to describe the group have commonly accepted the society of which the group is a part,” Jd, at 238, Particularity ensures that the group is “disorete” with “definable boundaries” such that itis not “amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective.” 1d. see also Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. at 335 (noting that social groups defined by their vulnerability to private criminal activity likely lack particularity, given that broad swaths of society may be susceptible to victimization). Respondent met his burden’6f establishing a well-founded fear of persecution on account ofa statutorily protected ground, his friembership in a particular social group. Respondent’s social group, “U.S, law enforcement labeled gang members” is cognizable, in that its members share an immutable characteristic that is socially distinct within Salvadoran society and defined with sufficient particularity. This characteristic is immotable, in that, according to Dr. Boerman, once an individual is labeled as a gang member in police records in El Salvador, there is no means by which to purge that identification from national databases, or from the awareness of local police renamed the “social visibility\"" requirement “social distinction” to clarify that it does not refer tothe literal visibility of @ social group. M-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dee, at 236; W-G-R, 26 1&N Dec. at 216; Paloka, 762 B.3d at 196-n.2, The (wo terms are substantively identical. A-E-V-G-, 26 1&N Dec. at 236; W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. at 216. a © The concept of particular social group is “broad enough fo encompass groups whose main shared trait s a common ‘one, such a5 gender, at least 0 fong as the group shares a further characteristic that is identifiable to would-be persectors and is immutable of fundameial” Gao v, Gomales, 440 F.3d 62, 64 (2d Cir. 2006), vacated and remanded on other grounds sub nom. Reiser v. Gao, $52 US. 801 (2007) 13 officers, The group is socially distinct; in that its members are compelled by Decree 717 to register and regularly report to the government, and the existence of the decree itself demonstrates a governmental and societal view of suspected gang-afliliated deportees fiom the U.S. to be especially suspect and warranting goyéinmental surveillance, ‘There is also sufficient evidence to suggest that respondent is a member‘ of this group, as the record established that the U.S. and Salvadoran governments participatesin two information sharing protocols, which apply to both criminal and immigration removal ifvestigetion records. Exh, 4, tab Z, p. 231. There is no evidence to suggest that respondent's 1-213, which identifies him as a gang member, will not automatically be shared with the Salvadoran government. While DHS counsel indicated that according to his own investigation, pefsonnel from ICE in New York do not share such information with Salvadoran authorities, counsel's statements camnot be construed as testimony or evidence. Further, those statements do not obviate the possibility that there may be additional documents in respondent's A file from the Suffolk: County Sheriff's Department that label respondent as a gang member Further, respondent’s fear is subjectively reasonable, considering that he was previously stabbed by a gang member and currently has an additional reason to feat their renewed interest, as he has been labeled an MS-13 gang shember by the U.S. government, which may cause him to be targeted by rival gangs in addition to'Baramilitary forces or the Salvadoran police. His fear is also objectively reasonable, as the recordjevidence, specifically Dr. Boerman’s written statement and testimony indicate that the Salvadoratgovernment will have access to respondent's [-213, which identifies him as an MS-13 member,” Dr. Boerman described several dozen incidents in wiich deportces identified as criminals, fetumed to El Salvador, were stopped and identified by Salvadoran authorities upon entty, atid then faced extra-judicial problems. The Salvadoran police and gangs have a violent, if at other times, symbiotic relationship with gangs, and respondent is, likely to be targeted as a gang member once he is identified upon entry into the country as @ labeled ‘gang member, Respondent also faces targeting by extra-judicial groups, which are often composed of police officers. Gang members are disproportionately killed during confrontations with members of the police, and E Salvadot’s Vice-President indicated in 2017 that police officers had the right to use deadly force against garg members “without any fear of suffering consequences.” Exh. 4 tab H, p. 110, tab J, p. 122. “According to the U.S. State Department 20/7 El Salvador Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the most significant human rights issues included alleged unlawful killings of suspected gang members and others by security forces; forced disappearances by military personnel, which the government prosecuted; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening. prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of government respect for judicial impartiality and independence and widespread government corruption, Impunity persisted despite government steps to dismiss and prosecute some officials in the security forces, the executive branch, and the justice system who committed abuses.’ In many neighborhoods, armed groups and gangs targeted certain persons, interfered with privacy, family, and home life, and created a climate of fear. Efforts by authorities to remedy these situations were generally ineffective. The major gangs controlled their own territory. Gang ‘members did not allow persons living in another gang’s controlled area to enter their territory, ‘even when travelling via public transportation. Gangs forced persons to present identification cards, The court takes administrative notice of the most recent State Department report, as it was not filed by ether party Yang v. MoElroy, 277 F.3d 158 (2d. Cir. 2002). 4 (containing their addresses) to determiite their residence. If gang members discovered that a person lived in a rival gang’s territory, that person risked being killed, beaten, or not allowed to enter the territory. 3 In sum, the testimonial and documentary record demonstrates that respondent has an objectively well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of both state and non-state actors in El Salvador on account of his membership in a particular social group. Cf: Scarlett v, Barr, ~-F.3d--, 2020 WL 2046544 (2d Cir. Apr. 28, 2020). Respondent’s status as a U.S, labelled gang member will render him subject to the requirements of Decree 717, which in turn will make him a target for Salvadoran police, extra-judicial forces and by rival gangs. This demonstrates a nexus between his feared harm and his meitbership in his social group. Accordingly, respondent has demonstrated his statutory eligibility for asylum, iii, Discretion : The court finds that respondent warrants a favorable exercise of discretion, While DHS has labeled respondent a gang member in the U,S., no evidence was provided to establish that respondent is or was in fact so affiliated, Further, despite having resided in the U.S. for many years, hhe has no criminal record, Although respondent entered the U.S. illegally and has remained here for over a decade, these actions are insufficient to deny his asylum application in the exercise of discretion. See Wu Zheng Huang, 436 F.3d at 99; see also Matter of Pula, 19 1&N Dee. at 473-74 (Discretionary denial should not be based solely on the respondent’s matter of entry into the United States.”) ‘Thus, when considering the totality of the circumstances, a grant of the application is warranted, 1d, Accordingly, the court grants the respondent’ application for asylum. 3 V. CONCLUSION ‘The respondent established that he is statutorily eligible for asylum and that he merits a favorable exercise of discretion under INA § 208, Accordingly, after a careful review of the record, the following order will be entered: Accordingly, after careful review of the record, the following orders will be entered: § As the court has granted the’ respéndent’s application for asylum pursuant to INA § 208, the remainder of arguments and his applications for withholding of removal under INA §281(bX3) and under CAT will ot be reached inthis decision. 8 CFR. §1208.16(0), 15 ORDER S HEREBY ORDERED that the respondent's application for asylum under INA § 208 be GRANTED, & Date: _6/15/20.
