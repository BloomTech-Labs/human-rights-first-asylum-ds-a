She entered the United States at or near Eagle Pass, Texas on January 22, 2014, without being admitted or paroled, Exh, 1, On March 3, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) commenced removal proceedings against the Respondent by-filing a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) with the Immigration Court. Exh. 1, On December 10, 2014, venue was changed to the Newark Immigration Court. At the initial master calendar hearing in Newark on May 31, 2016, DHS withdrew number four of the factual allegations contained in the NTA and amended the charges of inadmissibility from section 212(a\\(7)(A)(i)(1) to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i). The Respondent, through counsel, admitted the four remaining factual allegations in the NTA and conceded the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Accordingly, the Court sustained the charge, At the same master hearing, the Respondent filed an I-589 Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal with a detailed statement, Exh. 2, On February 13, 2019, she filed an updated 1-589 application. Exh, 2U On March 6, 2019, the Respondent appeared at her merits hearing and testified under oath at both hearings with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter. Il. Summary of the Evidence A.

Exh. 2U. On June 8, 2005, she met her common law husband, i). [1 August 2005, the Respondent and IM began to cohabitate together ail s mother’s home. At the beginning, the Respondent was happy in the relationship andiMMBLdid not mistreat her. However, on August 20, 2006, the relationship started to deteriorate. It began with small, occasional fights, which grew in intensity and frequency. NMMbegan coming home late at night. When the Respondent Page 2 of 11 inquired into his whereabouts, he would become angry, which would lead to a fight. Eventually, she became too afraid to speak tClJlIbecause of his angry outbursts On October 13, 2006, which wasfijqumms birthday, the Respondent left their home because of the verbal abuse and went to stay with her parents. She spoke with her sister INN who frequently traveled to Honduras and El Salvador for work, and decided to go with her. On October 2006, the Respondent traveled to Honduras withilNllillwhere she remained for approximately one month, When she returned INNMvas infuriated that she had left without his permission, He called her a “bitch” and told her that she had gone to Honduras to work as a prostitute and to sleep with her various lovers. AlthoughMllgidid not hit her, he told the Respondent that she was his property and that if she did not belong to him, she would not belong to anyone else. He also threatened to kill her by telling her not to report him because if she did he would be let out of jail, but she would never leave the cemetery On February 10, 2008, the Respondent decided to end her relationship with She went to live with her parents twenty minutes away. Then, on February 15, 2008, she left for Honduras with her sistelNNI For the following two-and-a-half months, the Respondent worked with her sister selling clothes and divided her time between Honduras and Nicaragua. During this time frequently went to the Respondent’s parents’ home looking for her. He also tried to convince her mother that he had changed. On May 15, 2008, the Respondent reconciled witHMllland resumed living with him at his mother’s home. In August 2008, she became pregnant NEEMbecame infuriated that she was pregnant and claimed that the child was not his, but from one of her lovers. Their so?7, i EEE wa born on April 3, 2009, via a caesarean section. The week after the Respondent gave birth and was recovering from her caesarean section, MEE came infuriated when the baby would not stop crying early in the morning. He reiterated that the baby was not his and that it was the child of one of her lovers. The Respondent told him that they could have a DNA test to prove paternity. MIIthen slapped her twice in the face and grabbed her by the hair and pulled her so he was twisting her neck, The Respondent’s mother-in- law heard her screaming and came to he!pgmmipunched his mother in the face, leaving her with a swollen eye. Neither the Respondent nor her mother-in-law filed a police report or sought medical treatment for fear of MINNIS reaction. Following this incident ANNMNNINs behavior continued to become more violent, He began raping the Respondent regularly. He called her names like “son of a bitch” and told her she was “worthless,” “disgusting,” and “fat.” He told her she belonged to him and threatened to kill her and her family if she tried to leave or report him In July 2009, the Respondent tried to leavdMlagain by escaping to Honduras with her sister INNNNMFor a third time. At the time of her departure from Nicaragua, she did not intend to return home because of her fear off. She stayed in Honduras for approximately 20 days, but then left for El Salvador when she heard thdMMMMhad travelled to Honduras looking for her. She stayed in El Salvador for approximately 15 days before he found her there. ‘The Respondent was selling clothes in a park near where she was staying When [Ill showed up. He called her a “fucking slut” and forced her to return to Nicaragua with him. During the bus ride back to Page 3 of 11 ‘Nicaragua, he mistreated her. Once they arrived back at his mother's house IJINNMleat her and repeatedly raped her. The Respondent remained in Nicaragua in a forced relationship with for the next four-and-a-half years. During this time INJIlllrepeatedly beat her and their son. He frequently swore at her, stole from her, and demanded that she work and provide for him. IM also continued to rape her regularly On January 7, 2014, the Respondent lef NNNNMIfor the last time and fled Nicaragua for the United States. She left her son with her parents in Nicaragua because she could not afford to bring, him. Since she left, her mother has been told that INlvants to take the child. IMhas gone to the Respondent's parents’ home searching for the child. The Respondent fears returning to her country of origin because she fears JEN will Kill her. For many years she was too scared to leavelIINbecause he threatened to kill her and her family if she left him. She was also too scared to report the abuse to the police because she had seen on the news that women who reported spouses for domestic violence were not protected and the husbands were not punished. Often these women ended up murdered by their abusive partners. Now that she has left her partner, the Respondent fears that he will kill her if she returns and that the police will do nothing to protect her. Additionally, the Respondent does not believe she will be safe anywhere in Nicaragua since she has gone so far as to move to Honduras and El Salvador tono avail beceuselINNNEMvas able to find her. IM. Relief from Removal—Law and Analysis A. Timeliness An applicant for asylum must prove by clear and convincing evidence that her asylum application was timely filed within one year of the date of her last arrival into the United States. INA § 208(a)(2)(B); 8 CFR. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii). Here, the parties do not dispute the timeliness of the Respondent's application for relief, B. Application of The REAL ID Act of 2005 All applications for relief filed after May 11, 2005 are subject to the REAL ID Act of 2005. The REAL ID Act amended INA § 208 and places all burdens of proof on the applicant. INA § 240(c)(4). ‘The applicant must establish that she satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements and that she merits a favorable exercise of discretion for relief. In this case, the REAL ID Act governs the Respondent's application. 1. Credibility As a threshold matter, the Court must make a determination of the Respondent’ credibility. A credibility finding is independent of an analysis of the sufficiency of an applicant's evidence. Chen v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir. 2005). Pursuant to the REAL ID Act, credibility determinations will be made “considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors.” INA § 240(c)(4)(C). A trier of fact may base a credibility determination on Page 4 of 11 ee a demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness’s account, the consistency between the applicant’s or witness's written and oral statements, the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record, and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility; however, if'no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) (emphasis added); see generally, Lin v. Att'y Gen,, 543 F.3d 114 Gd Cir. 2008) (affirming the 1’s adverse credibility determination based on discrepancies between his testimony and affidavit). The statutory language suggests that all relevant factors in the record be considered when determining credibility and that all the circumstances be considered when weighing any one factor, After a careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, the Court finds the Respondent credible. Her testimony was generally consistent with her detailed declaration and generally consistent with the evidence in the record. The Respondent was forthcoming and candid with information that was asked of her. The Court notes that there were some discrepancies between the Respondent’s testimony at the first individual hearing on August, 16, 2017 and the evidence presented with regard to the Respondent's trips to Honduras and El Salvador. However, afier taking these discrepancies into consideration, the Court finds that they do not detract from the Respondent's overall credibility 2. Corroboration An applicant bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion in connection with any application under INA § 208. INA § 208(b(1)(B); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(a); Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 215 (BIA 1985), modified on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 1&N Dec. 439, 446 (BIA 1987). An applicant’s own testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum without corroboration if the testimony is credible, persuasive, and “refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.” INA § 208(b)(1)(BYii); 8 CER. § 1208.13(a); Sandie v, Au'y Gen., 362 F.3d 246, 252 n.2 (3d Cir. 2009); Matter of J-Y-C- +24 1&N Dec. 260, 263 (BIA 2007). The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has recognized the difficulties an asylum applicant may face obtaining documentary or other corroborative evidence to support his claim of persecution. Matter of Dass, 20 1&N Dec. 124 (BIA 1989). As such, “[uJnreasonable demands are not placed on an asylum applicant to present evidence to corroborate particular experiences (e.g., corroboration from the persecutor).” Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 725 (BIA 1997). However, the weaker an applicant’s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence. Matter of Y-B-, 21 I&N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998) (citing Matter of E-P-, 21 1&N Dec. 860 (BIA 1997)) (determining that a finding of credible testimony by an asylum applicant is not dispositive as to whether asylum should be granted; rather, the specific content of the testimony and any other relevant evidence should be considered). ‘The ithholding of removal provision in INA § 241 refers to the corroboration provision contained in Page $ of 11 Cz INA § 208, indicating thet withholding applicants must also comply with the corroboration requirement of asylum applicants. In the event that the Court expects corroborating evidence, the Court must give the applicant notice of what corroborating evidence will be expected and the opportunity to provide such evidence or provide an explanation if the applicant cannot produce such corroboration. Saravia v, Att'y Gen., 905 F.34. 729, 737 (3d Cir. 2018) (finding that it was not fair to require the petitioner to provide further corroboration without telling him so and giving him the opportunity either to supply that evidence or to explain why it was not available). ‘The Court finds that the Respondent has corroborated her claim through, inter alia, country condition reports on Nicaragua (Exh. 3, 4, 7), a letter from the Jersey City Battered Women’s Services (Exh. 5), a psychological evaluation (Exh. 6), an affidavit from her sis‘ —_i OE, ond an affidavit from her fathc i The Respondent provided the affidavits of her sister and father after the Court gave her the opportunity to submit corroborating documents under Saravia, These corroborating documents, coupled with the Respondent's testimony, are sufficient to meet the standard for corroboration. C. Asylum under Section 208 of the Act Analien bears the evidentiary burden of proof and persuasion regarding eligibility for relief from removal. Section 240(c) of the Act. To be eligible for asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act, the Respondent must establish that she was persecuted in the past or that she has a well- founded fear of persecution in the future on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. See section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act; INS v, Elias- Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992); 8 C.F-R. § 1208.13(a). A claim of persecution must have a nexus to one of the five statutorily protected grounds. In cases where the REAL ID Act applies, such as, this case, the applicant must demonstrate that the protected ground would be “at least one central reason” for the persecution. Section 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. The protected ground does not need to be “the only central reason for the persecution ... [further,] an applicant need not prove that a protected ground was the most important reason why the persecution occurred.” Ndayshimiye v. Att'y Gen., 557 F.3d 124, 130 (3d Cir. 2009). If the Respondent establishes past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, it “shall be presumed that [her] life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.” 8 CF.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). The persecution must be or have been committed by the government or by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Gao v. Asherofi, 299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir. 2002); Kibinda v. Att'y Gen. 477 F.3d 113, 119 (Bd Cir. 2007) (quoting Fiadjoe v. Att'y Gen., 411 F.3d 135, 160 (3d Cir. 2005). 1. Past Persecution There is no universally accepted definition of “persecution.” See Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 51 (Geneva, January 1992), While “persecution” has generally been interpreted to include threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom, courts have also recognized that “the concept of persecution Page 6 of 11 i _ is broad enough to include governmental measures that compel an individual to engage in conduct that is not physically painful or harmful but is abhorrent to that individual's deepest beliefs.” Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1242 (3d Cir. 1993). Evidence that an asylum applicant was physically harmed by her persecutors and that the harm was severe and required medical attention, along with other harassment, may rise to the level of persecution. See Voci v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 607, 615 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding past persecution where the petitioner was found to have been beaten by police numerous times, which on one occasion, necessitated the petitioner’s extended hospitalization for a broken knee), Persecution does not, however, require that the applicant sustain permanent or serious injuries. Matter of O-Z- & I-Z-, 22 1&N Dec. 23, 25-26 (BIA 1998) (holding that persecution “encompasses a variety of forms of adverse treatment, including non-life threatening violence and physical abuse or non- physical forms of harm.\"); Gomez-Zuluaga v. Att'y Gen,, 527 F.3d 330, 341-45 (3d Cir. 2008). Furthermore, the severity of each incident should not be addressed in isolation without considering the cumulative effect of events. Fei Mei Cheng v, Ait'y Gen., 623 F.3d 175, 190-98 (3d Cir. 2010). Unfulfilled threats are not substantial enough to be characterized as past persecution. See Li v, Atl'y Gen., 400 F.3d 157 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding that unfulfilled threats must be highly imminent and menacing in nature to constitute persecution). Only where threats are “so menacing as 10 cause significant actual suffering or harm” may they constitute persecution, Chavarria v: Gonzalez, 446 F.3d 508, 518 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Liv. Att'y Gen. 400 F.3d 157 (3d Cir. 2005). The Court finds that the Respondent suffered harm that rises to the level of past persecution, She was in a nine-year-long relationship withINJINNthat was characterized by constant verbal, physical, and sexual abuse as well as emotional manipulation. Between 2005 and 2008, emotionally and verbally abused the Respondent, He controlled her by threatening to kill her and her family if she tried to leave him, Although he did not follow through on these threats, they were accompanied by physical and sexual violence, which makes them highly imminent and menacing. He was also verbally abusive and called her names like “son of a bitch,” “worthless,” “disgusting,” and “fat.” Immediately following the birth of the Respondent's son,IININNEEs abuse escalated to constant verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Iliibeat her countless times, including in front of her son, and, over a period of four-and-a-half years, he frequently raped her. The level of control and abuse in the relationship is further evidenced by the fact that INJNNNM followed the Respondent to Honduras and El Salvador and forced her to return through threats and intimidation. The lasting effect of the severity of the Respondent's harm is also highlighted by the fact that she takes part in a domestic violence support group at Jersey Battered Women’s Service; Exh. 5; and her psychological evaluation indicates a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Exh. 6. 2. Nexus to a Protected Ground ~ Particular Social Group ‘The Third Circuit has adopted the BIA’s definition of a particular social group as a group of individuals who share a “common, immutable characteristic” that cannot be changed or they should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences. See Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233 (3d Cir. 1993) (adopting the standard set forth in Matter of Acosta, 19 [&N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985)). The particular social group identified must be: Page 7 of 11 geananeinnasn a ene ate ane eel a (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic; (2) defined with particularity; and (3) socially distinct within the society in question. SERL. v. Att'y Gen, 894 F.3d 535, 535 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that Matter of M-E-V-G- is entitled to Chevron deference); see also Matter of W-G-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014). To show persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, the respondent must establish a cognizable particular social group, that she is a member of that group, and that the persecution was based on that membership. See Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d at 1239-40. In order for a particular social group to be cognizable, it must “exist independently” of the harm asserted. Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 334 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Matter of M-E- 26 I&N Dec. 227, 236 n.11, 243 (BIA 2014)). A particular social group “cannot be defined exclusively by the fact that its members have been subjected to harm.” Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 242 (BIA 2014) (internal quotations omitted). “{T]he individuals in the group must share a narrowing characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted.” Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 335 (A.G. 2018) (quoting Rreshpja v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir. 2005)), At the merits hearing on March 6, 2019, the Respondent claimed that she suffered past persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group, namely, 1) Nicaraguan ‘women who are viewed as property; 2) Nicaraguan women who are unable to leave their relationship; and 3) Nicaraguan women who resist their partners but are unable to leave their relationship. The second and third social groups the Respondent articulated are not cognizable under Matter of A-B-. See Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316, 334 (A.G. 2018). Thus, the Court finds these groups are not cognizable. Additionally, the evidence of record and the Respondent’s testimony lead this Court to conclude that the final social group, “Nicaraguan women who are viewed as property,” is not applicable in this matter and thet the more applicable particular social group is “Nicaraguan women.” Thus, the Court will proceed to analyze whether this group is cognizable under the standards set forth in Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014) and Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018). @ Nicaraguan women First, the proposed social group of “Nicaraguan women’ is immutable because gender and nationality are immutable characteristics that members of the group cannot or should not have to change. See Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. at 233 (holding that the enumerated grounds in the Act, including nationality, describe “an immutable characteristic: a characteristic that either is beyond the power of an individual to change or is so fundamental to individual identity or conscience that it ought not be required to be changed” and that in the context of particular social groups “[t]he shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex ...”). Second, the Court finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that the group is sufficiently particular. A particular social group must be defined by characteristics that provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group. M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 239 (citing Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, 24 I&N Dee. 69, 76 (BIA 2007)). The terms used to describe the group must have commonly accepted definitions in the society of which the group is a part. Id. The group must be discrete and have definable boundaries—it must not be amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective. 1d. Here, it is clear who falls within the social group “Nicaraguan women” and who does not because nationality and gender have commonly understood definitions that limit and define the Page 8 of 11 Ss a membership of the group. The group also is not defined by the harm and clearly exists independently of the underlying harm. See Matter of A-B-, 27 1&N Dec. at 317. Finally, “Nicaraguan women” is a socially distinct group in Nicaragua. “Social distinction” means social recognition, or “whether the people of a given society would perceive a proposed group as sufficiently separate or distinct [.]” M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dee, at 241. Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that Nicaraguan society perceives the Respondent's particular social group as distinct. The law shows that members of the Respondent’s social group are treated differently and seen as a distinct group under Nicaraguan law. Specifically, although gender equality is protected under the law, “women often experience ] discrimination in employment, credit, and pay equity for similar work, as well as in owning and managing businesses.” 207 U.S. Depariment of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, p. 22. Additionally, “NGOs complain{ } of delayed justice caused by judicial inaction and widespread impunity, especially regarding family and domestic violence and sexual abuse,” which are issues that disproportionately impact ‘women. Jd. at 8. Women’s organizations also reported that there were “unofficial orders” in the judiciary to decline ordering jail time or pretrial detention in domestic violence cases. Id. at 9 Furthermore, issues that primarily impact women, such as rape, domestic violence, and sexval harassment, are also outlawed. Jd. at 21. However, a recent change in the law has put in place a ‘mediation process specific to domestic violence complaints. Id. The presence of such extensive legal protections for women, and the different treatment women and issues that impact them receive, indicate that Nicaraguan society recognizes women as a distinct group in society. Finally, ‘women are not as influential in Nicaraguan society; for example, “most women in elected positions at the municipal or national level hfold] limited power or influence within their respective bodies.” Id, at 18. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has demonstrated that “Nicaraguan women” is a cognizable particular social group. Furthermore, the Respondent has shown that at least one of the central reasons targeted her was on account of her membership in the particular social group “Nicaraguan women,” Byron felt entitled to abuse her because she is a woman and domestic violence is committed with impunity in Nicaragua. 2017 U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, pp. 8-9, 21. He told her that she belonged to him, indicating a feeling of ownership over her because of her inferior status as a woman. He also refused to accept that she no longer wished to be in a relationship with him, and even went so far as to follow her to Honduras and then E] Salvador. He told her that if she reported him, he would be let free and she would end up in the cemetery, demonstrating that he felt at liberty to target the Respondent because women are not protected or seen as equals. Thus Sargeted the Respondent because she is a Nicaraguan ‘woman Therefore, the Court finds that the Respondent has established that her past persecution was on account of her membership in the particular social group “Nicaraguan women.” 3. Persecution the Government is Unable or Unwilling to Control Page 9 of 11 | zz An applicant for asylum must demonstrate that the persecution was committed by the government or by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. Kibinda v. Att'y Gen., 477 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir. 2007). The Respondent testified that women in relationships are not afforded protection by the Nicaraguan government and men are able to abuse their partners with impunity. Police do not protect women from abusive partners and do not punish perpetrators of domestic violence. The Respondent's testimony is corroborated by country conditions in the evidence of record, Cases involving domestic violence and sexual abuse are characterized by “judicial inaction and widespread impunity.” 2017 U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report: Nicaragua, p. 8 Domestic violence cases continue to be subject to the unofficial order to refrain from ordering jail time or pretrial detention, Jd. at 9. Although rape and domestic violence are criminalized, “the government failfs] to enforce the law effectively, leading to widespread impunity and reports of increased violence from released offenders emboldened by their release.” Jd. Furthermore, “violence against women over the past eight years [has increased in severity} and th{e] police generally understated the level of violence against women.” Jd, at 21 Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Respondent has shown that the Nicaraguan government is unable or unwilling to protect her. 4, Rebuttable Presumption of Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution Since the Respondent has established past persecution in Nicaragua on account of a protected ground, she is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution if she must return to Nicaragua. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). The DHS bears the burden to rebut the Respondent's presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. Specifically, the DHS must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent's fear is no longer well-founded due to a fundamental change in circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). The presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution may also be overcome if the DHS demonstrates that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that it would be reasonable to do so. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). DHS must show that there is a specific area of the country where the risk of persecution to the applicant falls below the well-founded fear level. Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 28, 33 (BIA 2012). In this case, the DHS failed to rebut the presumption that the Respondent has a well- founded fear of future persecution by either showing that intemal relocation is possible and reasonable or a fundamental change in circumstances. Accordingly, the Respondent has met all the requirements for asylum and the Court will grant the application as a matter of discretion. D. Withholding of Removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act and Withholding of Removal under the Convention Against Torture Because the Court grants the Respondent’s application for asylum, it need not reach the merits of her applications for withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. See Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. at 449; see also INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S, 24 (1976) (government agencies are not required to make findings on issues which are unnecessary to the result), Page 10 of 11 fe —_—— In light of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent's application for asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act is GRANTED: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent's application for withholding of removal to Nicaragua pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act is NOT REACHED; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent's application for withholding or deferral of removal to Nicaragua pursuant to the Convention Against Torture is NOT REACHED. pas 1Z/~ Cee Hon, Shifta Rubin Immigration Judge Page 11 of 11
