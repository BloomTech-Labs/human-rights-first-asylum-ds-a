Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We The Resposidpat’s motion for a custody redetermination is denied for lack of jurisdiction. On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1). Consequently, the Respondent’s motion to request a bond hearing is denied. \"" Ifthe DHS determines that the Respondent is a class member such that this rule does not apply, the DHS shall inform this court and Respondent's counsel.

Glynn, Esq. ‘Assistant Chief Counsel 537 Broadway Office of the Chief Counsel Everett, MA 02149 15 New Sudbury Street, Room 425 . Boston, MA 02203 ON RESPONDE! *S MOTION TO REOPEN 1. Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge """

We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii).

The Court sustained the charge Respondent seeks relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E. Exhibit 3 is for identification only. It was not admitted into evidence. Exhibit 4 is the credible fear notes. Exhibit 5 is the child's, Keily Janeth, 1-213. And Exhibit 6 is the Record of Sworn Statement of the respondent, Respondent Maura Suyapa Varela-Erazo was the only witness who testified on her behalf. The Court has considered all the evidence regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision. TIMELINESS AND CREDIBILITY The Department stipulated and the Court finds that the application is timely. In all asylum cases, the Court must determine whether the testimony of the respondent and any witness is credible. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). The Court observed the respondent as she testified. She was candid and forthright in her demeanor and the experiences that she described in her testimony were inherently plausible and believable. The Department pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony and the answers that she provided in her credible fear interview and the interview she had immediately a: a 2 November 2, 2016 STU] Oy 2p Jue jaUseIFMMM | TT “aqUAD ayerjaddy a upon entering this country. The Court questioned respondent in great detail about these issues that are brought up by the Department. Specifically that was of concern to the Court was a statement or a response that she had in her credible fear interview in which she stated that in response to a question if her husband did anything else to her, she testified that she did not let him rape her and her daughter came and said that not to fight and he beat the child and then the respondent started running to a neighbor. The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness. LAW AND ANALYSIS To be eligible for asylum, the respondent must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future os a 3 November 2, 2016 1a]Ua>) 2} TI MMM. | persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion. She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity. The Fifth Circuit has adopted the willful blindness standard for government acquiescence. Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge "

Garcia, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondents are an adult male and his minor daughter, both natives and citizens of El Salvador, who were ordered removed in absentia on August 22, 2017.' The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated January 17, 2018, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed a brief in support of his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in response. The appeal will be sustained In a statement accompanying his motion, the respondent stated, under oath, that he arrived at the Miami, Florida, Immigration Court around 7:50 a.m. for his August 22, 2017, hearing and that because of a delay caused by a very long line outside the courthouse, he was not able to appear in the Immigration Judge’s courtroom until about 8:15 to 8:20 that moming. By that time, the Immigration Judge already had ordered his removal in absentia. The respondent requested to be given a second opportunity and stated that he never intended to abandon his case and that he wishes to apply for political asylum because of fear to return to El Salvador. Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i), and in light of the circumstances presented, including the facts that the respondent exercised due diligence by filing his motion to reopen within days after the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of removal and that the DHS filed no opposition to the respondent's motion or to his appeal, we will sustain the appeal to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge.

The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii). We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge erred in denying protection under the Convention Against Torture. ‘CEASED in the Immigration Judge’s findings that the 2 Cite as: M-S-V-E-, AXXX XXX 957 (BIA Aug. 7, 2017) & za addy rn MMM | youoe. 957 cra. lead respondent did not present evidence that she suffered past torture in Honduras, and has not shown a likelihood of future torture, by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of “willful blindness”) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, if removed to Honduras.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: ANDERSON LEAL ON BEHALF OF DHS: CHRISTINIA TOWNSEND, ORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE PROCEDURAL HISTORY The respondents are a mother and her minor daughter.’ The respondent is a ‘native and citizen of Honduras who entered the United States without valid entry documents on or about November 22, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security \"" The cases are consolidated. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to \""the respondent” singularly applies also to the rider applicant. served respondent with a Notice to Appear charging her as removable from the United States under Section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent admitted to the factual allegations and conceded the charge of removability. The Court sustained the charge Respondent seeks relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E. Exhibit 3 is for identification only. It was not admitted into evidence. Exhibit 4 is the credible fear notes. Exhibit 5 is the child's, Keily Janeth, 1-213. And Exhibit 6 is the Record of Sworn Statement of the respondent, Respondent Maura Suyapa Varela-Erazo was the only witness who testified on her behalf. The Court has considered all the evidence regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision. TIMELINESS AND CREDIBILITY The Department stipulated and the Court finds that the application is timely. In all asylum cases, the Court must determine whether the testimony of the respondent and any witness is credible. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). The Court observed the respondent as she testified. She was candid and forthright in her demeanor and the experiences that she described in her testimony were inherently plausible and believable. The Department pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony and the answers that she provided in her credible fear interview and the interview she had immediately a: a 2 November 2, 2016 STU] Oy 2p Jue jaUseIFMMM | TT “aqUAD ayerjaddy a upon entering this country. The Court questioned respondent in great detail about these issues that are brought up by the Department. Specifically that was of concern to the Court was a statement or a response that she had in her credible fear interview in which she stated that in response to a question if her husband did anything else to her, she testified that she did not let him rape her and her daughter came and said that not to fight and he beat the child and then the respondent started running to a neighbor. The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness. LAW AND ANALYSIS To be eligible for asylum, the respondent must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future os a 3 November 2, 2016 1a]Ua>) 2} TI MMM. | persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion. She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity. The Fifth Circuit has adopted the willful blindness standard for government acquiescence. Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

The respondent admitted to the factual allegations and conceded the charge of removability. The Court sustained the charge Respondent seeks relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E.

TIMELINESS AND CREDIBILITY The Department stipulated and the Court finds that the application is timely. In all asylum cases, the Court must determine whether the testimony of the respondent and any witness is credible. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). The Court observed the respondent as she testified. She was candid and forthright in her demeanor and the experiences that she described in her testimony were inherently plausible and believable.

The Court questioned respondent in great detail about these issues that are brought up by the Department. Specifically that was of concern to the Court was a statement or a response that she had in her credible fear interview in which she stated that in response to a question if her husband did anything else to her, she testified that she did not let him rape her and her daughter came and said that not to fight and he beat the child and then the respondent started running to a neighbor. The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness. LAW AND ANALYSIS To be eligible for asylum, the respondent must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future os a 3 November 2, 2016 1a]Ua>) 2} TI MMM. | persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion. She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity.

The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

Accordingly, we conclude that the lead respondent has shown that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground. We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ‘ordered conditions are not met as 9 required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion 3 voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the & following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately * effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice z to Appear. 2 Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties: 1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

Garcia, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondents are an adult male and his minor daughter, both natives and citizens of El Salvador, who were ordered removed in absentia on August 22, 2017.' The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated January 17, 2018, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed a brief in support of his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in response. The appeal will be sustained In a statement accompanying his motion, the respondent stated, under oath, that he arrived at the Miami, Florida, Immigration Court around 7:50 a.m. for his August 22, 2017, hearing and that because of a delay caused by a very long line outside the courthouse, he was not able to appear in the Immigration Judge’s courtroom until about 8:15 to 8:20 that moming. By that time, the Immigration Judge already had ordered his removal in absentia.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED. Oy 3p YU IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent be GRANTED voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings under INA § 240B(b), in lieu of removal, without expense to the Government, on or before May 11, 2012, or any extensions as may be granted by the Field Office Director, Department of Homeland Security, and under any other conditions the Field Office Director may direct. addy aa8 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent post a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $500 with the Department of Homeland Security within 5 business days. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ‘ordered conditions are not met as 9 required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion 3 voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the & following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately * effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice z to Appear. 2 Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties: 1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status. INA § 240B(4), Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he appeals this decision Respondent must A047 654 200 6 March 12, 2012 ra) a“) provide to the Board of Immigration Appeals, within 30 days of filing an appeal, sufficient proof of having posted the voluntary departure bond. The Board will not reinstate the voluntary departure period in its final order if Respondent does not submit timely proof to the Board that the voluntary departure bond has been posted. 8 CFR. § 1240.26(¢)(3)(i). Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he or she does not appeal this decision and instead files a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period, the period allowed for voluntary departure will not be stayed, tolled, or extended, the grant of voluntary departure will be terminated automatically, the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately, and the above penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229¢(d), will not apply. 8 CF.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1). ~ Becenset DAYNA BEAMER Immigration Judge A047 654 200 7 March 12, 2012"

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1).

Glynn, Esq. ‘Assistant Chief Counsel 537 Broadway Office of the Chief Counsel Everett, MA 02149 15 New Sudbury Street, Room 425 . Boston, MA 02203 ON RESPONDE! *S MOTION TO REOPEN 1. Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

Accordingly, we conclude that the lead respondent has shown that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground. We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii). We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge erred in denying protection under the Convention Against Torture. ‘CEASED in the Immigration Judge’s findings that the 2 Cite as: M-S-V-E-, AXXX XXX 957 (BIA Aug. 7, 2017) & za addy rn MMM | youoe. 957 cra. lead respondent did not present evidence that she suffered past torture in Honduras, and has not shown a likelihood of future torture, by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of “willful blindness”) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, if removed to Honduras.

The respondent admitted to the factual allegations and conceded the charge of removability.

Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E.

The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness.

She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity.

Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

She asserts that her husband, with whom she lived for 20 years and had three children, ‘finally fled after he chased her with a machete. The Immigration Judge found that the lead respondent was a credible witness (IJ at 2-3) and that the harm she suffered rose to the level of ersecution (IJ at 4). ae at 4-7). The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

Accordingly, we conclude that the lead respondent has shown that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground. We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii). We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge erred in denying protection under the Convention Against Torture. ‘CEASED in the Immigration Judge’s findings that the 2 Cite as: M-S-V-E-, AXXX XXX 957 (BIA Aug. 7, 2017) & za addy rn MMM | youoe. 957 cra. lead respondent did not present evidence that she suffered past torture in Honduras, and has not shown a likelihood of future torture, by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of “willful blindness”) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, if removed to Honduras.

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We The Resposidpat’s motion for a custody redetermination is denied for lack of jurisdiction. On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1). Consequently, the Respondent’s motion to request a bond hearing is denied. \"" Ifthe DHS determines that the Respondent is a class member such that this rule does not apply, the DHS shall inform this court and Respondent's counsel.

Glynn, Esq. ‘Assistant Chief Counsel 537 Broadway Office of the Chief Counsel Everett, MA 02149 15 New Sudbury Street, Room 425 . Boston, MA 02203 ON RESPONDE! *S MOTION TO REOPEN 1. Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii).

Unless otherwise noted, any reference to \""the respondent” singularly applies also to the rider applicant. served respondent with a Notice to Appear charging her as removable from the United States under Section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent admitted to the factual allegations and conceded the charge of removability. The Court sustained the charge Respondent seeks relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E. Exhibit 3 is for identification only. It was not admitted into evidence. Exhibit 4 is the credible fear notes. Exhibit 5 is the child's, Keily Janeth, 1-213. And Exhibit 6 is the Record of Sworn Statement of the respondent, Respondent Maura Suyapa Varela-Erazo was the only witness who testified on her behalf. The Court has considered all the evidence regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision. TIMELINESS AND CREDIBILITY The Department stipulated and the Court finds that the application is timely. In all asylum cases, the Court must determine whether the testimony of the respondent and any witness is credible. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). The Court observed the respondent as she testified. She was candid and forthright in her demeanor and the experiences that she described in her testimony were inherently plausible and believable. The Department pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony and the answers that she provided in her credible fear interview and the interview she had immediately a: a 2 November 2, 2016 STU] Oy 2p Jue jaUseIFMMM | TT “aqUAD ayerjaddy a upon entering this country. The Court questioned respondent in great detail about these issues that are brought up by the Department. Specifically that was of concern to the Court was a statement or a response that she had in her credible fear interview in which she stated that in response to a question if her husband did anything else to her, she testified that she did not let him rape her and her daughter came and said that not to fight and he beat the child and then the respondent started running to a neighbor. The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness. LAW AND ANALYSIS To be eligible for asylum, the respondent must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future os a 3 November 2, 2016 1a]Ua>) 2} TI MMM. | persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion. She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity. The Fifth Circuit has adopted the willful blindness standard for government acquiescence. Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED.

The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1).

Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We The Resposidpat’s motion for a custody redetermination is denied for lack of jurisdiction. On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1). Consequently, the Respondent’s motion to request a bond hearing is denied. \"" Ifthe DHS determines that the Respondent is a class member such that this rule does not apply, the DHS shall inform this court and Respondent's counsel.

Glynn, Esq. ‘Assistant Chief Counsel 537 Broadway Office of the Chief Counsel Everett, MA 02149 15 New Sudbury Street, Room 425 . Boston, MA 02203 ON RESPONDE! *S MOTION TO REOPEN 1. Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

Garcia, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondents are an adult male and his minor daughter, both natives and citizens of El Salvador, who were ordered removed in absentia on August 22, 2017.' The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated January 17, 2018, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed a brief in support of his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in response. The appeal will be sustained In a statement accompanying his motion, the respondent stated, under oath, that he arrived at the Miami, Florida, Immigration Court around 7:50 a.m. for his August 22, 2017, hearing and that because of a delay caused by a very long line outside the courthouse, he was not able to appear in the Immigration Judge’s courtroom until about 8:15 to 8:20 that moming. By that time, the Immigration Judge already had ordered his removal in absentia. The respondent requested to be given a second opportunity and stated that he never intended to abandon his case and that he wishes to apply for political asylum because of fear to return to El Salvador. Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i), and in light of the circumstances presented, including the facts that the respondent exercised due diligence by filing his motion to reopen within days after the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of removal and that the DHS filed no opposition to the respondent's motion or to his appeal, we will sustain the appeal to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he or she does not appeal this decision and instead files a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period, the period allowed for voluntary departure will not be stayed, tolled, or extended, the grant of voluntary departure will be terminated automatically, the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately, and the above penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229¢(d), will not apply. 8 CF.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1). ~ Becenset DAYNA BEAMER Immigration Judge A047 654 200 7 March 12, 2012"

The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

Accordingly, we conclude that the lead respondent has shown that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground. We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii).

The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness.

She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity. The Fifth Circuit has adopted the willful blindness standard for government acquiescence. Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

She asserts that her husband, with whom she lived for 20 years and had three children, ‘finally fled after he chased her with a machete.

The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

Accordingly, we conclude that the lead respondent has shown that she suffered harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground. We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal. See Matter of L-S-,25 18N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1 (ii). We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge erred in denying protection under the Convention Against Torture. ‘CEASED in the Immigration Judge’s findings that the 2 Cite as: M-S-V-E-, AXXX XXX 957 (BIA Aug. 7, 2017) & za addy rn MMM | youoe. 957 cra. lead respondent did not present evidence that she suffered past torture in Honduras, and has not shown a likelihood of future torture, by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of “willful blindness”) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, if removed to Honduras.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ‘ordered conditions are not met as 9 required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion 3 voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the & following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately * effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice z to Appear. 2 Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties: 1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he or she does not appeal this decision and instead files a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period, the period allowed for voluntary departure will not be stayed, tolled, or extended, the grant of voluntary departure will be terminated automatically, the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately, and the above penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229¢(d), will not apply. 8 CF.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1). ~ Becenset DAYNA BEAMER Immigration Judge A047 654 200 7 March 12, 2012"

The Immigration Judge also denied protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 7-8). On review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that Marter of A-R-C-G- is factually distinguishable because the lead respondent in this case did not physically attempt to leave her relationship. The lead respondent credibly testified that her husband regularly beat and raped her, that he did not allow her to leave the house and beat her when she would do so, that he beat her severely upon her return from a single trip to her mother’s house, that he threatened to find her and harm her if she were to leave, and that she did not leave him because she was afraid (IJ at 4-6) On this record, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the lead respondent did not show she was unable to leave her relationship with the father of her three children, ' The lead respondent’s minor daughter (EEN is a derivative applicant on the lead respondent's appli for asylum, and did not file a separate application on her own behalf.

We will, however, to determine whether the lead respondent has shown thi See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). First, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered the totality of the country conditions evidence presented. The Immigration Judge cited information in the U.S, Department of State's 2014 Human Rights Report for Honduras indicating that the government of that country was taking steps to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence and had opened a shelter in Copan, where the respondent was living (LI at 6-7). However, notwithstanding that she cited the existence of the shelter in considering whether the government was unable or unwilling to protect the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have considered that the same paragraph of the report stated the “government provided insufficient financial and other resources to enable these facilities to operate effectively” (Exh. 2, Tab D, at 41). Further, the Immigration Judge does not appear to have made factual findings regarding the effect, if any, of the lead respondent's testimony that she lived “in the mountains” and that the police were “very far away” (Tr. at 39, 35) on whether the police in fact were unwilling or were unable to protect her (Respondent's Br. at 7-8). In addition, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make findings regarding the respondent's testimony that she did not report her abuse to the police because the police did nothing after her father was murdered (Ir. at 56-57). Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider whether the government was unable or was unwilling to protect the lead respondent based on the totality of the country condition evidence and the lead respondent's testimony. On remand, should the Immigration Judge find that the lead respondent has established past persecution, including that the government was unable or is unwilling to protect her, she should Getennine ‘nthe frst instence whether the DES DS RGU TNG RAREUEDHIOD tat the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has bi 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 1&N Dec. 28, 31 (BIA 2012). In determining whether it would be reasonable to expect the lead respondent to relocate, the Immigration Judge should consider each of the factors set forth at 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(3), in light of the applicable burden of proof. If the Immigration Judge finds that the DHS has rebutted the presumption that the lead respondent has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim, she should determine whether the lead respondent has compelling reasons arising out of the severity of the past persecution for being unwilling or unable to return to Honduras or whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon her removal.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: ANDERSON LEAL ON BEHALF OF DHS: CHRISTINIA TOWNSEND, ORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE PROCEDURAL HISTORY The respondents are a mother and her minor daughter.’ The respondent is a ‘native and citizen of Honduras who entered the United States without valid entry documents on or about November 22, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security \"" The cases are consolidated. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to \""the respondent” singularly applies also to the rider applicant. served respondent with a Notice to Appear charging her as removable from the United States under Section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent admitted to the factual allegations and conceded the charge of removability. The Court sustained the charge Respondent seeks relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Today was the hearing on her applications for relief. EVIDENCE The Notice to Appear is Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the 1-589 with attachments comprising of tabs A through E. Exhibit 3 is for identification only. It was not admitted into evidence. Exhibit 4 is the credible fear notes. Exhibit 5 is the child's, Keily Janeth, 1-213. And Exhibit 6 is the Record of Sworn Statement of the respondent, Respondent Maura Suyapa Varela-Erazo was the only witness who testified on her behalf. The Court has considered all the evidence regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the text of this decision. TIMELINESS AND CREDIBILITY The Department stipulated and the Court finds that the application is timely. In all asylum cases, the Court must determine whether the testimony of the respondent and any witness is credible. See Matter of O-D-, 21 1&N Dec. 1079, 1081 (BIA 1998). The Court observed the respondent as she testified. She was candid and forthright in her demeanor and the experiences that she described in her testimony were inherently plausible and believable. The Department pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony and the answers that she provided in her credible fear interview and the interview she had immediately a: a 2 November 2, 2016 STU] Oy 2p Jue jaUseIFMMM | TT “aqUAD ayerjaddy a upon entering this country. The Court questioned respondent in great detail about these issues that are brought up by the Department. Specifically that was of concern to the Court was a statement or a response that she had in her credible fear interview in which she stated that in response to a question if her husband did anything else to her, she testified that she did not let him rape her and her daughter came and said that not to fight and he beat the child and then the respondent started running to a neighbor. The Government argued that in today's testimony the respondent testified that she was raped and also in her application the respondent states that she was raped by her husband, In response to the Court's question, the respondent clarified that she was testifying or she was answering about a specific incident in which the rape was stopped because of the daughter coming in and the husband did not rape her, but she was raped on numerous occasions. The Court accepts her explanation. The Government also pointed out some inconsistency as to the name of the father. On Exhibit 5, which is the [-213 for the child, itis really not clearte- the Court Vhen the Court examines the decumentit-states father name and address and it is blank and the next sentence says nationality and that is where it says Honduras and next to Honduras, it says Jose. So the Court does not accept this as something that the respondent stated to the officer that Jose was the name of the father. She has consistently maintained that she has been with this person for the last 20 plus years and he is the father of her three children. Considering the entire record and specifically the respondent's demeanor, the Court is going to find her to be a credible witness. LAW AND ANALYSIS To be eligible for asylum, the respondent must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future os a 3 November 2, 2016 1a]Ua>) 2} TI MMM. | persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion. She must also show that the persecution she fears will be inflicted by the government or that the government is unable or unwilling to control the persecutor. PAST PERSECUTION Persecution is an extreme concept and it does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive, unfair or unjust. In this case, the respondent testified that sinee-starting some time in 2010, her husband became very abusive towards her. She testified that he would beat her on a regular basis and also sexually abuse her and make her do things that she did not want todo. She testified that he would beat her with his fists and would leave bruises on her body. She testified that he did not like for her to go out of the house and if she did, he ‘would beat her and threaten her that she should not tell anybody about the abuse or he was going to kill her. This abuse went on for at least four to five years. Respondent testified that on one occasion, the last occasion before she left the country, he beat her and then followed her outside the house with a machete and threatened her that if he ever saw her, he was going to kill her. Respondent was very afraid for her life and she believed that he would kill her or at least cut her feet off, as she had seen some incidents on the news in which a partner had cut his wife's, partner's feet. Respondent also testified that when her youngest child tried to intervene and ask her father not to beat her mother, he would threaten her as well Based on this record, the Court finds that the harm that the respondent suffered ‘in her home country does rise to the level of persecution. The Court's analysis for eligibility for asylum does not end with the finding that the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution. The respondent still must show that | 4 November 2, 2016 > JURIST] it was on account of one of the protected grounds. Respondent argues that she was persecuted and she fears future persecution because she is a member of a particular ‘social group. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Deo, 388 (BIA 2014), the Board found that married women in Guatemala who were unable to leave their relationship is a cognizable social group under the Act. The Board found that marital status can be an immutable characteristic where the individual is unable to leave the relationship. The Board found that \""married,\"" \""women\"" and “unable to leave a relationship\"" were terms commonly understood within the Guatemalan society. What was very important to the Board's analysis in Matter of A-R-C-G- was the fact that the respondent in that case was unable to leave the relationship, making it an immutable characteristic. The evidence in that case was that the respondent was in a long, abusive relationship and had suffered ‘severe abuses at the hands of her partner. She had made numerous efforts to leave the relationship, but had been unsuccessful. Each time she tried to leave, her husband would find her and threaten and bring her back to him The evidence in this case is significantly different. Respondent testified that she was in a relationship with Mr. Gavino Pineda for more than 20 years and they were living together for more than 20 years, They did get married legally in September of 2010 and that is when the husband became abusive towards her. Respondent testified that she really did not make any efforts to leave him because she was afraid. She, however, testified that during this period where she was being abused by her husband, she was able to go visit her mother who lived about two hours away. Respondent has presented no evidence why she could not have remained with her mother or leave her husband and go to some other location, The only testimony she presented was that he had threatened her that he was going to find her and harm her if she were to leave. mos a 5 November 2, 2016 I 34 ar > ry T1 “MMM | youroe. However, no evidence was presented as to how the husband would have the ability (1) to find her and (2) harm her if she were to leave him. Respondent, therefore, has failed to present any evidence that she belongs to a particular social group comprising of ‘women who are unable to leave their relationship because she has failed to show any evidence that she made any efforts to leave. Secondly, the Board in A-R-C-G- placed great significance to the fact that the respondent in that case made numerous efforts to seek the protection from the police and unfortunately for her each time she did try that, the police was unwilling to help her and stated that they would not interfere in domestic matters. The respondent in this case never reported her abuse to the police. She testified that she never reported it to the police. She never told any of her family members. The reason she stated she did not report to the police was because the husband had threatened her and plus the police does not do anything. However, she presented no evidence as to how she knows that the police does not do anything and why she did not make an effort to file a police report when she got a chance to move away from her husband and visit her mother two hours away. No evidence has been presented that ‘the police would have been unable or unwilling to protect her. Respondent has also failed to show that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As stated earlier, she had family, parents and sisters, who lived in different cities, but respondent made no effort to seek their assistance or go and live with them, Respondent has presented the Country Report that does talk about violence against women and domestic violence being a serious problem in her home country, my 6 November 2, 2016 1auaD ayeyjaddy a 11’ TMMM | yeu'o cone shelter is in Copan, which appears to be the place the respondent was living. She has presented no evidence why she did not seek assistance from these organizations or she did not seek shelter in these domestic abuse victim shelters that is mentioned in the Country Reports. Based on the above, the Court will find that respondent has failed to show past persecution on account of one of the protected grounds and she has also failed to show that the government in her country is unable or unwilling to protect her or that she could have not relocated to another part of her country. Similarly, respondent has also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. To be eligible for asylum, the respondent has to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds, as well as show that the government in her country would be unable and unwilling to protect her and that she could not have relocated to another part of the country. As discussed above, respondent has failed to meet her burden to show any of these elements. Therefore, she is not eligible for asylum under Section 208 of ‘the Act. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than asylum. Because respondent has failed to meet the lower burden for asylum, she cannot meet ‘the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (Sth Cir. 2008) CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE RELIEF To be eligible for protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, the respondent must establish that she would more likely than not be subject to torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official mo a 7 November 2, 2016 [1] ‘JaquaD a}e] your'e. or person acting in an official capacity. The Fifth Circuit has adopted the willful blindness standard for government acquiescence. Respondent here has presented no evidence that she has suffered torture in her ‘home country and has failed to present any particularized evidence that she will be tortured if she were to return back to her country. Any fear of torture that she has is. speculative and is not supported by the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court will enter the following orders.

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final.

Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

Clebson Cameiro-De Sousa IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula Melntosh, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent’s March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained. We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 CFR. § 1241.1(e); see also 8 CFR. § 241.4(b)(1) (“An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for consideration of relief from removal . . . shall remain subject to the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.”). On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1).

Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds.

We have specifically considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral ‘wamings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent’s motion to reopen, at which time his removal order became final.

On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release imposed by the Department of Homeland Security—namely, the use of a GPS monitoring device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien’s release once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.FR. § 1236.1(d)(1).

Glynn, Esq. ‘Assistant Chief Counsel 537 Broadway Office of the Chief Counsel Everett, MA 02149 15 New Sudbury Street, Room 425 . Boston, MA 02203 ON RESPONDE! *S MOTION TO REOPEN 1. Procedural History On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the Respondent, Clebson Sousa Cameiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo, Texas. Exh. 2, Form 1-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id. Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations, DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Jd. The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015). The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined. tot aoe i) Exh, 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id In addition, the Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the course of his removal proceedings. Id Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22, 2014); see also Exh. 1 On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing, along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the record suggests that the notice was retumed as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia, Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Ia. I. Motion to Reopen On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2. According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Jd, at 3. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that he “did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them [his] address at: 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” /d. at 5, 174]6. Accordingly, because the NTA “did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Jd. at 5. Alternatively, the Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICEs entire request for reporting” and “made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7. The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. {dat 2. In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form 1-589. Jd, at Tabs C-D. IIL, Standards of Law In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to ‘the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.” Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (Ist Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (Ist Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See \""The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C. ‘The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id at Tab D, 32-34 2 A ° Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (Ist Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3) (4) (2014). The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. /d. With respect to orders of removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C-F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 CER. § 1003.13. The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. /d.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, $04 F.3d 144, 147 (Ist Cir. 2007). To reopen his case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. 8 CFR. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v, Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 1&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a “general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 1&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). IV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Asa preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent’s motion to reopen is timely as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.23(bY(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January 21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)ii). To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. I-1A; Form [-830. Accordingly, delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N 4 > Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures.”). Moreover, this was the same address listed on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 1&N Dec. at 673 (“{W]hen a respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail”). In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant factors and emphasizing that “(eJach case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.”). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent’s incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery). Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent's notice of hearing was returned to the Court as. undeliverable, Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment #2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot to Reopen at 5, 1746. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v, Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (Ist Cir. 2007). Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument—even if inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 CFR. § 1003.15(4)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 1&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“{The] presumption of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery . . . [if] the respondent {] present{s} substantial and probative evidence . . . demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due 10 the respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.”) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a & 2? potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an alien’s address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Jmmigration Court... an address . . . at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1 You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you change your address . . . during the course of this proceeding.) (emphasis added). Finally, and especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent, See Exhs. 1-1A. Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013 Exh. I. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the Respondent’s address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“{A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 CER. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.” See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA 2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the “on account of” element in asylum and withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant’s burden to initially identify the particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F. 34 120, 125 (Ist Cir. 2005) (*[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the social group with which he claims to be associated.”). At most, the Respondent indicated in his second affidavit that he and his family’s home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local ? Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D. a > police because “these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after years away... . [because] these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 ¥ 13-20. However, even if the Court infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See Rojas-Perez v, Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (Ist Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as ‘having money’ and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally cognizable social groups.” Accordingly, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED. 22 Tey ens Se Date MATTHEW D’ANGELO Immigration Judge"

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ‘ordered conditions are not met as 9 required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion 3 voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the & following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately * effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice z to Appear. 2 Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties: 1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status.

Garcia, Esquire APPLICATION: Reopening The respondents are an adult male and his minor daughter, both natives and citizens of El Salvador, who were ordered removed in absentia on August 22, 2017.' The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated January 17, 2018, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed a brief in support of his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in response. The appeal will be sustained In a statement accompanying his motion, the respondent stated, under oath, that he arrived at the Miami, Florida, Immigration Court around 7:50 a.m. for his August 22, 2017, hearing and that because of a delay caused by a very long line outside the courthouse, he was not able to appear in the Immigration Judge’s courtroom until about 8:15 to 8:20 that moming. By that time, the Immigration Judge already had ordered his removal in absentia. The respondent requested to be given a second opportunity and stated that he never intended to abandon his case and that he wishes to apply for political asylum because of fear to return to El Salvador. Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i), and in light of the circumstances presented, including the facts that the respondent exercised due diligence by filing his motion to reopen within days after the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of removal and that the DHS filed no opposition to the respondent's motion or to his appeal, we will sustain the appeal to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge.

Gannon, Esquire APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture The respondents are a mother (hereinafter, “the lead respondent”) and her child (hereinafter, “the minor respondent”) who are natives and citizens of El Salvador. They appeal an Immigration Judge's January 17, 2018, decision denying them asylum, and denying the lead respondent withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings. We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). The lead respondent, whose credibility has never been at issue, testified that she has been persecuted and will be persecuted by members of the “18” gang in El Salvador on account of her family ties to the minor respondent. According to the lead respondent, “18” gang members came to her house in October 2015, banged on the door, and threatened to kill her and the minor respondent if she did not tum the minor respondent over to them for recruitment purposes (IJ at 5; Tr. at 20-25). “18” gang members also directly threatened the minor respondent on a separate occasion that if he did not join the gang, he and his mother would be killed (IJ at 5-6; Tr. at 26). Gang members continue to appear at the respondents’ house in El Salvador to try to recruit the minor respondent and/or his brothers (LJ at 5-6; Tr. at 27-28), We find error in the Immigration Judge’s ultimate conclusion that the lead respondent has not demonstrated past persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group (IJ at 7- 8). In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, death threats from gang members qualify as past persecution. See e.g.. Hernandez-Avalos v, Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (4th Cir. 2015) (finding past persecution where the petitioner received death threats from Mara 18); Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 126 (4 Cir. 2011) (finding that three death threats from MS-13 constituted persecution). Moreover, the lead respondent has shown that the gang members who threatened her and the minor respondent were motivated, for at least one central reason, by a protected ground under the Act. See section 208(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. AME-583 et al. § 1158(b)(1(B)(ii). One’s membership in a family can qualify as membership in a particular social group for purposes of asylum or withholding of removal. See Salgado-Sosa v. Sessions, 882 F.3d 451, 457 (4th Cir. 2018); Velasquez v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 188, 194 (4th Cir. 2017); Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d at 949; Crespin-Valladares v, Holder, 632 F.3d at 124-25. In this case, the “18” members who were threatening the lead respondent were clearly targeting her, for one central reason, because she was the mother of the minor respondent, and not out of any personal animus against the lead respondent herself. Because the lead respondent has demonstrated that she suffered past persecution based on her familial ties to the minor respondent - a protected ground under the Act ~ she is afforded the regulatory presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution in El Salvador. See 8 CFR. § 1208.13(b)(I). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may rebut this presumption by showing by a preponderance of the evidence either that: (1) “{tJhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant's country of nationality,” or (2) “{tJhe applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's country of nationality ... and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.” 8 CFR. §§ 1208.13(b)(1)((A), 1208.13(by(1)()(B). Accordingly. the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to afford the DHS an opportunity to do so before the Immigration Judge. On remand, both parties may introduce additional evidence, both testimonial and documentary, with respect to any and all relevant issues in this case prior to the entry of a new decision.! Accordingly, the following orders will be entered. ORDER: The appeal is sustained, FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision. FOR THE BOAI ' Given our disposition of this matter, we need not address the respondents’ remaining contentions on appeal."

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS APPEAL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire ON BEHALF OF DHS: Heith M. Kaneshige Acting Chief Counsel APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 12,2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in the exercise of discretion. We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(4)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section 212(¢) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 21 2(a\\7)(A)(i(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(), as an immigrant with no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) wu] ap qu yourseIr MMM A047 654 200 misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must also demonstrate that he is “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admi because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a wi under section 212(e) of the Act. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however, that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent's argument for several reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement. Itapplies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the ‘Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year foreign residency requirement and was therefore not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The respondents appeal is dismissed. FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229e(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (A). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, 2 Cite as: Ali Fares, AO 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013) rMMM A047 654 200 orextended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 CFR. § 1240.26(e)(1). WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits 1,2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1 student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. /d. In December 1999, Respondent departed the United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York, asa DV2 immigrant. /d. On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009, Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. /d. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent ‘was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). /d. Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or ddy OD for permanent residence until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident, rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2. On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form I-862, Notice to Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 212(a\\(7(A)(i)(). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings. See 8 CFR. § 1003.14(a). ‘Ata master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of ‘counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability. Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was seeking a212(e) waiver from the Department of State. On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e) waiver was deni On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012, Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10. On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he A047 654 200 2 March 12,2012 ddy 6D a) requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS, which was granted. Respondent’s individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11. On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye’s office but they were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondents individual hearing was rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative. Il. ANALYSIS The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent ‘was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence requirement [212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, “No.” /d. Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa. A. 212(e) Waiver Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section 212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10. Under 212(e), No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J), (i) whose participation in the program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by A047 654 200 3 March 12, 2012 ddy TMMM the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101 (a)(J) was a national or resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information ‘Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged, or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or section 101(a)(15)(L) until itis established that such person has resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States: Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an alien described in clause (ii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attomey General to be in the public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such alien, 1a} Itis undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA § 101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore, Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(I (A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 1985), MMM B. — 237(a)(1)(H) Waiver Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for A047 654 200 4 March 12, 2012 oO ~ Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e). The provisions of section 237(a)(|) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission, whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attomey General, be waived for any alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry document. See Matter of Fu, 23 1&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of families composed, in part, of US. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. 408, 416-17 (BIA 1998). Analien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)()(ID. Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children. However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his visa application, Respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA § 212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of Musharraf, 17 1&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980). Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on huey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a waiver under former INA § 241(0) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.24 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien’s equitable estoppel claim where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)). A047 654 200 5 March 12, 2012 a ~) While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 1&N Dec. at 412-16. ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered: ORDER IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 212(e) is DENIED. IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) is DENIED.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ‘ordered conditions are not met as 9 required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion 3 voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the & following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately * effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice z to Appear. 2 Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties: 1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(). 2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in nonimmigrant status. INA § 240B(4), Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he appeals this decision Respondent must A047 654 200 6 March 12, 2012 ra) a“) provide to the Board of Immigration Appeals, within 30 days of filing an appeal, sufficient proof of having posted the voluntary departure bond. The Board will not reinstate the voluntary departure period in its final order if Respondent does not submit timely proof to the Board that the voluntary departure bond has been posted. 8 CFR. § 1240.26(¢)(3)(i). Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he or she does not appeal this decision and instead files a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period, the period allowed for voluntary departure will not be stayed, tolled, or extended, the grant of voluntary departure will be terminated automatically, the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately, and the above penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229¢(d), will not apply. 8 CF.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1). ~ Becenset DAYNA BEAMER Immigration Judge A047 654 200 7 March 12, 2012"
