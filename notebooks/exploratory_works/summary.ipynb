KaneshigeActing Chief CounselAPPLICATION Section aH waiverThe respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration JudgesMarch , , decision denying the respondents application for a waiver of removabilityunder section aH of the Immigration and Nationality Act,  U.S.C.  aH, inthe exercise of discretion.Immigrant  Refugee Appellate Center  www.irac.netWe review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility,made by the Immigration Judge. See  C.F.R.  .di. We review de novo all otherissues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues ofdiscretion. See  C.F.R.  .dii. Since the respondents application was filed afterMay , , it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act.The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondents applicationfor naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security DHS because he wasnot lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that therespondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent residentbecause he did not comply with the requirement of his J nonimmigrant status under sectione of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the year foreign residencyrequirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the year foreign residency requirement undersection e of the Act. In November of , the DHS filed a Notice to Appear NTA withthe Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section aA ofthe Act,  U.S.C.  aA, as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of statusunder section aAiI, of the Act,  U.S.C.  aAiI, as an immigrant withno valid immigrant visa or entry document Exh. . In June of , the respondents requestfor a section e waiver was denied. In August of , the respondent filed a request for awaiver under section aH of the Act.Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated byclear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondentapplied for a waiver under section aH of the Act asserting it would waive hisCite as Ali Fares, A   BIA Apr. , A  misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that itwould waive the year foreign residence requirement under section e of the Act.In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section aH of the Act, analien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the UnitedStates or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and mustalso demonstrate that he is otherwise admissible at the time of his admission. The ImmigrationJudge concluded that the respondent was not otherwise admissible at the time of his admissionbecause he had not met either the year foreign residency requirement or received a waiverunder section e of the Act.Weagree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver undersection aH of the Act because he was not otherwise admissible at the time of hisadmission. Section e of the Act,  U.S.C.  e. The respondent concedes that, havingbeen admitted to the United States under section aJ of the Act,  U.S.C. aJ, he was subject to the year home residency requirement. He argues, however,that a waiver under section aH of the Act waives the year foreign residencerequirement under section e of the Act. We reject the respondents argument for severalreasons. First, section e of the Act is clear. It requires a year home residence followingcompletion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement.It applies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section aJ of the Actin order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section e of theAct is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the year foreignresidency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent isineligible for waiver under section aH of the Act because he did not satisfy the yearforeign residency requirement and was therefore not otherwise admissible at the time of hisadmission. Accordingly, the respondents appeal will be dismissed.Immigrant  Refugee Appellate Center  www.irac.netORDER The respondents appeal is dismissed.FURTHER ORDER Pursuant to the Immigration Judges order and conditioned uponcompliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent ispermitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by theDHS. See section Bb of the Act,  U.S.C.  cb see also  C.F.R.  .c, f.In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall beremoved as provided in the Immigration Judges order.NOTICE If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the timeperiod specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civilpenalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of years for any further relief under section B and sections A, , , and  of theAct. See section Bd of the Act.WARNING If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expirationof the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure isautomatically terminated the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled,Cite as Ali Fares, A   BIA Apr. , A  or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing ofa motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section Bd of the Act shall not apply.See  C.F.R.  .e.WARNING If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicialchallenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section of the Act,  U.S.C.  , the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, andthe alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files apetition for review and then departs the United States within  days of such filing, therespondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien providesto the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs EnforcementField Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient thathe or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart undersection Bd of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review,notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petitionfor review is pending.

On February , , Respondent filed a motion to advance hisindividual hearing. See Exhibit . On March , , Respondent appeared for his individualhearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA  aH alone andmade closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative.II.ANALYSISThe DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removableas charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to theUnited States as a lawful permanent resident in December  because he made a materialmisrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his Jnonimmigrant status under INA  e. In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copyof Respondents immigrant visa application. See Exhibit . The application asked if Respondentwas an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the year foreign residencerequirement e and he checked the box marked, No. Id.Immigrant  Refugee Appellate Center  www.irac.netRespondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his Jnonimmigrant status under INA  e, and claimed that he did not know about the intricaciesof the year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made amisrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged underINA  aA because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrantwho was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa.A.e WaiverRespondent sought a waiver of the twoyear foreign residence requirement of Sectione with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit.Under e,No person admitted under section aI, i whose participation in theprogram for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part,directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or byA  March , the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, ii who at thetime of admission or acquisition of the status under aJ was a national orresident of a country which the Director of the former United States InformationAgency now the Secretary of USDOS, pursuant to the regulations prescribed byhim, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged,or iii or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medicaleducation or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or forpermanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section aH orsection aL until it is established that such person has resided and beenphysically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for anaggregate of at least two years following departure from the United StatesProvided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to therequest of an interested United States Government agency or, in the case of analien described in clause iii, pursuant to the request of a State Department ofPublic Health, or its equivalent, ... the Attorney General may waive therequirement of such twoyear foreign residence abroad in the case of any alienwhose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in thepublic interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department ofPublic Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by aninterested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described inclause iii, the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section  andprovided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause iii, theAttorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waivesuch twoyear foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreigncountry of the aliens nationality or last residence has furnished the Director astatement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of suchalien.Immigrant  Refugee Appellate Center  www.irac.netIt is undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA SaJi and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as apermanent resident in  because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia foran aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore,Respondent is removable under INA  aA. Respondent applied for a waiver under INA e however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of HomelandSecurity. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA  e in this case as a favorablerecommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an applicationfor a waiver of the twoyear foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji,  IN Dec. BIA .B.aH WaiverRespondent applied for a waiver under INA  aH, asserting that it would waivehis misrepresentation for answering No to question J on the form , Application forA  March , Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits , . Respondent also asserts that theaH waiver waives the year foreign residence requirement under INA  e.The provisions of section a of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on theground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA aCi for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission,whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be waived for anyalien who meets the requirements under section aHi or ii of the Act. The Board ofImmigration Appeals BIA has also found that INA  aH authorizes a waiver forcharges of inadmissibility under INA  aAi, for a lack of a valid visa or entrydocument. See Matter of Fu,  IN Dec. ,  BIA . The BIA has recognized thatCongresss intent in enacting INA  aH was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity offamilies composed, in part, of U.S. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam,  IN Dec. , BA .An alien meets the requirements of INA  aHi if he is the spouse, parent, son,or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanentresidence. INA  aHi. However, the alien must also have been in possession of animmigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of suchadmission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA  aA not inpossession of a labor certification and A not in possession of a valid immigrant visa orother required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section  of theAct, which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA  aHII.Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children.However, although a waiver under INA  aH could waive the misrepresentation on hisvisa application, Respondent was not otherwise admissible at the time of his admission as apermanent resident in , because he had not resided and been physically present in thecountry of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years followingdeparture from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA e, the exclusive means to waive the year foreign residence requirement. Matter ofMusharraf,  IN Dec.  BIA .Immigrant  Refugee Appellate Center  www.irac.netRespondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirementsunder INA  e, because INA  aH can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying onChuey v. INS,  F.d ,  th Cir. . However, this case was explicitly overturnedby the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS,  U.S. ,   holding that awaiver under former INA   does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified inINA  a other than former subsection . The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit haspreviously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the twoyear foreignresidence requirement under INA  e, even when it engages in negligent misconduct. SeeMukherjee v. INS,  F.d  th Cir.  denying the aliens equitable estoppel claimwhere the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the year foreignresidence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA  e.A  March , While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent isstatutorily ineligible to apply for a aH waiver because he was not otherwiseadmissible at the time of his admission in .
