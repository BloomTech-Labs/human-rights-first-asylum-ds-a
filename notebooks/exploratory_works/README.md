| ocr_accuraccy_testing.ipynb                            | Labs 32 | This notebook is designed to find the best method of converting pdf to text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `poppler-utils`,`tesseract-ocr`,`pyPDF2`,`pdf2image`,`pytesseract`              |
| get_outcome.ipynb                                      | Labs 34 | This notebook is designed for testing and developing the get_outcome method. It has code to run two versions of the method on all 170 cases, compare the two versions and display cases where they disagree, as well as measure their accuracy against the manually scrapped data and show cases that the newer version of the method gets wrong. Contact me, River Bellamy, with any questions. | pandas, spaCy |  
| get_interpreter.ipynb                                 | Labs 34 | I started this, using get_outcome.ipynb as a starting point, intending to do the same thing with get_interpreter. I then realized that our manually scrapped data doesn't include information about an interpreter. Since we have no labeled data for this field, I moved on to another one. So this notebook never got very far. Contact me, River Bellamy, with any questions. | pandas, spaCy |  
| check_for_one_year.ipynb                              | Labs 34 | This notebook is designed for testing and developing the check_for_one_year method. It has code to run two versions of the method on all 170 cases, compare the two versions and display cases where they disagree, as well as measure their accuracy against the manually scrapped data and show cases that the newer version of the method gets wrong. Contact me, River Bellamy, with any questions. | pandas, spaCy |  
| get_protected_grounds.ipynb                              | Labs 34 | This notebook is designed for testing and developing the get_protected_grounds. It is not updated with the most recent version of the method. It has code to run two versions of the method on all 170 cases, compare the two versions and display cases where they disagree, as well as measure their accuracy against the manually scrapped data and show cases that the newer version of the method gets wrong.

| cPython_wrapper.py            | Labs 33 | Can be appended to the OCR function to output a file that contains the runtime and number of indivdual function calls ran within the ocr.py file.            | `cProfile`                                    |
| GCP_pdf_to_json_conversion.py | Labs 33 | Pings the GCP storage bucket to run the Google Cloud Vision API on each pdf in the bucket, which creates a JSON response that contains confidence percentages for each letter and the full resulting text to be extracted by 'json_to_txt_conversion.py' | `google.cloud.vision`, `google.cloud.storage` |
